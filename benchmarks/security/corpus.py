"""Labelled dataset for the shield detector benchmark.

Honesty matters more than a big number here (see the council review that
motivated this suite). Cases carry an explicit ``split`` so a memorised
result can never masquerade as a capability claim:

* ``train``   -- the existing regression corpus the built-in rules were
                 *tuned against* (``shield_jailbreak_corpus.txt``). High TPR
                 here proves no regression, NOT detection skill.
* ``heldout`` -- novel attack phrasings authored for this benchmark that the
                 rules were never edited to catch. TPR here is the real
                 capability signal; the train/heldout gap estimates overfit.
* ``benign``  -- agent-realistic non-attacks (code, tool output, docs, and
                 deliberate false-positive bait). Drives the FPR floor.

Obfuscated variants are built at runtime (``obfuscations`` below) so the
source stays readable and carries no literal encoded blobs -- matching the
convention in ``test_injection_corpus.py``.
