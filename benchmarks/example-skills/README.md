## Schema

```markdown
---
name: short-kebab-case-id
triggers:
  - natural language phrase that should activate this skill
  - another phrase
tools_needed:
  - shell
  - write_file
---

# What this skill does

One paragraph.

# Steps

1. ...
2. ...

# Notes

Gotchas, anti-patterns, things that did NOT work.
```

Keep skills mechanical -- a future agent should be able to follow them
without improvising. The `# Notes` section is the most valuable; it's
where we encode what NOT to do.
