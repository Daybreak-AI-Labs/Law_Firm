"""Maverick -- proof of guarantees.

Not unit assertions buried in a suite: a single reproducible run that drives the
REAL roster (the shipped domain packs) through the REAL enforcement code -- the
same primitives the production tool chokepoint (``agent._run_tool``) calls --
and prints a scoreboard of the product's core promises.

    python proof/run_proof.py        # exits 0 iff every guarantee holds

The "control plane is the product" claim, made checkable. Five guarantees run
anywhere; two cryptographic ones (Ed25519) need ``cryptography`` and otherwise
report ``CI`` (they run in the test matrix).

The guarantees themselves live in :mod:`maverick.proof_guarantees` (the single
source of truth shared with ``maverick.proof_pack``); this file is the
standalone scoreboard around them.
