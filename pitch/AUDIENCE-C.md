# Lightwork — For a First Customer / Design Partner (Audience C)

> **Audience:** an enterprise buyer / design partner in a regulated industry —
> the CISO, compliance officer, head of ops, and GC who decide whether an agent
> ever touches their systems.
> **Goal:** turn "ungoverned agents are too risky" into "we'll run a governed
> pilot." Sell governance, security, compliance, and provable ROI — not equity.
> **Format:** 12 slides. On-slide copy (terse) + visual direction.
> **Honesty rule:** every number here is real and verifiable from this repo, or
> marked `[FILL]` for a customer-specific fact (their controls, ROI, terms).

## Slide 1 — Title
**On slide:**
- **Lightwork** — *by Daybreak Labs*
- *Put your AI agents to work — under governance you can prove.*
- Tag (top-right): **For `[FILL: customer]` · Confidential**
- `[FILL: contact]`

**Visual:** Wordmark on dark, faint chokepoint watermark.

---

## Slide 2 — Your reality
**On slide:**
- You're under pressure to deploy AI agents. In **regulated, high-stakes operations**, ungoverned agents are a risk you can't accept:
  - No proof they stayed in policy. No tamper-evident record.
  - Data-exfiltration exposure. Unbounded actions. No accountability.
  - No way to prove they won't quietly **drift**.

**Visual:** A wall of red X's — no audit · no egress control · no proof · no accountability.

---

## Slide 3 — The dilemma
**On slide:**
- Two bad options today: **fall behind**, or **deploy ungoverned** and inherit audit / compliance / security risk.
- The demo wins. Then your **CISO, compliance officer, and GC** ask: "show me what it did, prove it can't exfiltrate our data, prove it won't get worse" — and it **dies in pilot**.

**Visual:** A split — "the demo" (slick) vs "the diligence review" (red X's). The chasm between them.

---

## Slide 4 — Meet Lightwork
**On slide:**
- **A governed agent workforce — not a chatbot, not a framework.**
- Every action passes **one chokepoint**: capability → policy (allow / deny / require-human) → safety shield → hard budget → tamper-evident audit.
- **Self-host or air-gap, on your data.** Work lands where a **human signs off**.

**Visual:** The hero chokepoint diagram (reuse the seed deck's hero SVG).

---

## Slide 5 — Governance you can prove (not claim)
**On slide:**
- `maverick proof-pack` → an **Ed25519-signed** evidence bundle (governance guarantees, reliability cert, SLA, shield results), verifiable **offline**.
- **Live golden path:** a finance specialist boots **SEALED**, a **$60k wire is DENIED**, a **$6k release REQUIRES a human**, a runaway loop is **CAPPED** — and altering one audited row is **caught**.

**Visual:** The "receipts" table (SEALED / DENY / REQUIRE_HUMAN / CAPPED / TAMPER-EVIDENT) + signed `PROOF.md`.

---

## Slide 6 — Security & compliance posture
**On slide:**
- **Self-host / air-gap** — runs in your environment with no required egress.
- **Egress lock** — an app-layer lock blocks the agent's LLM/HTTP exfil paths (pair with a network firewall to also cover raw-shell egress).
- **Capability tokens (attenuate-only)** — least privilege, per action.
- **Sandbox network-off by default** · **hard budget caps**.
- **Signed, hash-chained audit** — tamper-evident, offline-verifiable.
- Maps to `[FILL: your controls — SOC 2 / HIPAA / SOX / GLBA / data-residency]`.

**Visual:** A control → Lightwork-mechanism mapping table.

---

## Slide 7 — The work it does
**On slide:**
- **2,020 least-privilege specialist packs across 53 suites.** (The finance suite alone declares ~**29 governed deliverables across 11 roles**.)
- A goal's result renders as a **typed deliverable** → a per-role **inbox** → a human **certifies** it → it routes into **Salesforce / ServiceNow** (signed, audited).

**Visual:** Deliverable → inbox → sign-off → system-of-record flow.

---

## Slide 8 — It provably improves (your ROI)
**On slide:**
- A **closed, audited learning loop** — offline consolidation ("dreaming"), per-department memory, a causal flywheel that mines self-correcting guardrails from real outcomes (every causal claim **survives a placebo test**; snapshot / rollback).
- It **provably improves, not drifts.**
- ROI on your workload: `[FILL: hours saved / error reduction / cycle-time]`.

**Visual:** An improvement-over-time curve with a "governed · rollback-able" note.

---

## Slide 9 — How it deploys in your environment
**On slide:**
- **Self-host / VPC / air-gap.** 8 packages (native installers + source today; PyPI publish wired, pending first tag) · Docker / K8s / VPS · **MCP server** (drive from Claude Code / Cursor / any MCP client) · GitHub Action.
- Integrates with your stack (**Salesforce / ServiceNow**). Your security review gets to "yes" faster because **it runs in your environment with no required egress**.
- `[FILL: your environment specifics]`

**Visual:** Deployment topology inside your VPC.

---

## Slide 10 — Proof it's real today
**On slide:**
- **Built and installable now (alpha):** ~**310K LOC** across **8 packages** (native installers + source today; PyPI publish wired, pending first tag), native installers for Win / macOS / Linux, **2,020 lint-clean packs** (0 errors).
- **Run the Proof Pack yourself.**
- `[FILL: references / named design partners]`

**Visual:** A "built ✅" checklist + a big honest stat: "2,020 packs, 0 lint errors."

---

## Slide 11 — The pilot
**On slide:**
- A **design-partner pilot**: one regulated workflow, scoped.
- **30 / 60 / 90-day plan** with success criteria you set.
- `[FILL: pricing / pilot terms]`
- Land one workflow, prove governance + ROI, **expand across the 53 suites**.

**Visual:** A 30 / 60 / 90 timeline.

---

## Slide 12 — Get started
**On slide:**
- **What we need from you:** `[FILL: one workflow · an executive sponsor · a security contact]`.
- **Next step:** `[FILL: a 60-minute scoping session]`.
- Contact / `[FILL]`

**Visual:** A simple CTA + contact line.

---

## What I need from you (the `[FILL]`s)
1. **Customer** — who this is for (name on the title + tailored examples).
2. **Their controls** — the compliance frameworks to map to (SOC 2 / HIPAA / SOX / GLBA / data-residency).
3. **ROI** — the workload + any numbers (hours saved, error/cycle-time reduction).
4. **Pilot terms** — pricing, scope, success criteria.
5. **Contact / next step.**
