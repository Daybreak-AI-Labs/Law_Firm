//! Zed extension for the Maverick agent runtime.
//!
//! Zed extensions run as WASM in a WASI sandbox: they cannot spawn
//! processes themselves. The one extension hook that launches a real local
//! process is the context-server hook — the extension *returns* a command
//! and Zed spawns it. We use it to register Maverick's MCP server
//! (`maverick mcp`, stdio transport — packages/maverick-mcp), which is the
//! product's official cross-language surface, so Zed's assistant can drive
//! the swarm: start goals, check status, read results.
//!
//! Terminal-style CLI verbs (`maverick status` / `monitor` / `halt` / ...)
//! cannot be exec'd from sandboxed extension code, so they ship as Zed
//! *tasks* instead: see tasks/maverick.json and the README.
