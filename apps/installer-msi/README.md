# maverick-installer-msi (engineering bootstrap)

WiX Toolset v4 authoring for an **engineering-only** Windows bootstrap. It
installs a `maverick.cmd` launcher on the per-user PATH plus one
`maverick-agent` wheel, then asks pip to resolve that wheel's dependencies from
live PyPI on first launch.

This is not a complete Lightwork platform installer. It omits the other seven
packages in `release-cohort.toml`, does not bundle Python or a dependency
wheelhouse, is not offline-capable, and is not a customer release artifact.

## What's in the package

| Piece | What it does |
|---|---|
| `Package.wxs` | WiX v4 product/package definition: per-user scope, stable `UpgradeCode`, `MajorUpgrade` rule, PATH environment component |
| `maverick.cmd` + `maverick_bootstrap.py` | Launcher installed to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\Maverick\bin`. Installs the bundled core wheel (`--user`) on first run and whenever its installed version differs from the MSI cohort; pip resolves dependencies from live PyPI |
| `build.ps1` | `wix build` invocation; takes the wheel path and version |
| `test_wxs.py` | Static contract test (XML well-formed, UpgradeCode pinned, perUser scope, no hardcoded user paths) |

Design notes:

- **Per-user by default** (`Scope="perUser"`): no UAC, installs under
  `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\Maverick`, and the PATH component edits the *user*
  PATH only (`System="no"`).
- **`UpgradeCode` is a constant** (`9E2B7C41-6A8D-4F3B-8E5A-2C90D17B4F6E`).
  Never change it: `MajorUpgrade` uses it to find and replace older versions.
  `test_wxs.py` pins the exact value so a drive-by edit fails CI.
- **The launcher uses the console-script entry point.** `py -m maverick`
  does not work — `packages/maverick-core/maverick/` has no `__main__.py` —
  so `maverick.cmd` runs `python -c "from maverick.cli import main; main()"`
  (the same target as the `maverick` console script in
  `packages/maverick-core/pyproject.toml`).
- **The wheel keeps its PEP 427 filename.** The MSI preserves the built
  `maverick_agent-<version>-<python>-<abi>-<platform>.whl` basename because pip
  rejects a renamed `maverick_agent.whl` before reading it. The launcher reads
  the MSI ProductVersion and skips bootstrap only when
  `importlib.metadata.version("maverick-agent")` matches it exactly; upgrades
  therefore cannot silently continue running an older user-site package.
- **Python and network access are prerequisites, not bundled capabilities.**
  The MSI does not embed a Python runtime, a locked dependency wheelhouse, or
  the full eight-package release cohort. `maverick.cmd` prints an actionable
  error if Python 3.10+ is missing; pip otherwise resolves runtime dependencies
  from live PyPI without a shipped constraints file. There is currently no
  supported offline/customer MSI.

## Building

Requires a **Windows host**, the **WiX v4 CLI**, and a **built wheel**:

```powershell
dotnet tool install --global wix
python -m pip install build
python -m build --wheel packages/maverick-core
cd apps\installer-msi
.\build.ps1 -Wheel ..\..\packages\maverick-core\dist\maverick_agent-0.1.7-py3-none-any.whl
```

There is also a manual-dispatch engineering workflow
(`.github/workflows/build-msi.yml`) that builds the core wheel and bootstrap
MSI on `windows-2022`. Its artifact name and metadata identify it as an
unsigned engineering bootstrap requiring live PyPI.

## Status — honest

- **Engineering-only:** this bootstrap is deliberately excluded from release
  completeness claims. A complete Windows delivery must install an offline
  artifact containing the whole release cohort without running pip against
  live package indexes.
- The staged wheel filename and first-install/upgrade bootstrap have an offline
  `--no-deps --no-index` filename smoke test. That test validates only wheel
  staging; it does not make the real first-launch dependency install offline.
- The `.wxs`, launcher, and build script were authored and statically
  validated (`test_wxs.py`) in a Linux environment. **No MSI was built or
  installed here** — that requires WiX v4 on a Windows host. Treat the first
  `build.ps1` run as a release candidate to smoke-test.
- The produced MSI ships **UNSIGNED**. SmartScreen can show an "unknown
  publisher" warning until an Authenticode signing path exists.

## Testing

```bash
python -m pytest apps/installer-msi/test_wxs.py -q
```
