"""The wizard must collect the per-sender allowlist that channels require.

Regression for the launch-audit HIGH: discord/telegram/slack/signal/matrix/
email/bluesky/mastodon raise ValueError without an allowlist, but the wizard
never prompted for one, so a wizard-only setup produced channels that silently
failed to start (server.py logs + continues). pick_channels now collects it.
