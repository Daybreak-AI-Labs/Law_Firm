# Sales / GTM agent suite — the revenue engine

**Status:** design / roadmap. Companion to
[`finance-agent-suite.md`](finance-agent-suite.md),
[`it-grc-agent-suite.md`](it-grc-agent-suite.md), and
[`../enterprise/architecture.md`](../enterprise/architecture.md). Indexed in
[`agent-suites-overview.md`](agent-suites-overview.md).

"GTM" here is the **whole go-to-market motion** — Marketing → Sales Development →
Sales/AE → Customer Success → Support, with RevOps and Enablement as the connective
tissue. ~50 agents (45 base + 5 council-added) across eight towers.

> **What makes GTM different from finance and GRC.** Those domains are *inward-
> facing* — the blast radius is the books or the control set. GTM agents are
> **outward-facing at scale**: they contact prospects, publish content, spend ad
> budget, and quote prices. A wrong send is a **reputational, deliverability, and
> regulatory** event (CAN-SPAM, GDPR/PECR, TCPA, FTC), not a mis-statement. So the
> product is again the **governance wrapper** — and Lightwork already owns the exact
> chokepoint: the multi-channel engagement layer, AI/bot disclosure, the consent
> gate, high-risk classification of every "send" tool, and rate/spend caps. GTM is
> **rich substrate, greenfield workflow.**

The cardinal rule for every agent below (the GTM analogue of finance's "never move
money"):

> *Research, draft, score, and recommend freely — but NEVER send an external
> message, publish content, spend ad budget, commit a price or discount, or change a
> customer record of account without the required human gate. And NEVER contact
> anyone who has opted out or whom you lack a lawful basis to contact.*

## 1. What's already shipped — the reuse map

Status vocabulary as before: **Shipped** / **Partial** / **Gap** / **Process-only**.
GTM has a surprisingly strong base because the *engagement* primitives already exist.

| Existing capability | Module / surface | Status | Reused by |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Multi-channel engagement** (email, SMS, voice, WhatsApp, Slack, Telegram, Signal, Discord, Mastodon, Bluesky, Matrix, iMessage) | `packages/maverick-channels/` (13 adapters) | **Shipped** | SDR (2.2), Nurture (1.6), Social (1.3), Support (6.1) |
| **AI / bot disclosure** (EU AI Act Art 50, CA SB 1001) | `compliance.py` (`first_turn_disclosure`) | **Shipped** | every customer-facing agent |
| **"Send" tools classified high-risk** (the gate basis) | `safety/tool_risk.py` (`email`/`gmail`/`ses`/`sns`/`twilio`/`slack_bot`/…) | **Shipped** | the outbound gate (§3.1) |
| **Human-in-the-loop send gate** | `safety/consent.py` (`ask`/`dashboard`) | **Shipped** | every outbound action |
| **Cadence / sequence scheduling** | `scheduler.py`, `worker.py` | **Shipped** | Sequencing (2.4), Nurture (1.6) |
| **Conversational lead intake** | `intake.py` | **Shipped** | Inbound qual (2.1), Support (6.1) |
| **Conversation / contact memory** | `world_model.py` | **Shipped** (CRM connector is the system of record → build) | all |
| **Volume / spend / deliverability caps** | `safety/rate_limiter.py`, `quotas.py`, `net_concurrency.py`, `budget.py` | **Shipped** | §3.8 |
| **Data privacy** (PII redaction, egress/residency, encryption) | `safety/pii_detector.py`, `enterprise.py`, `crypto_at_rest.py` | **Shipped** | §3.7 |
| **Prospect/customer data rights** (DSAR, erasure, ROPA) | `dsar.py`, `audit/erase.py`, `ropa.py` | **Shipped** (reuse the privacy suite) | §3.7 |
| **Discount/approval gate** | `governance.py` (+ amount-aware policy) | **Partial** (amount-aware is the shared finance build) | Deal Desk (3.4) |
| **Knowledge** (battlecards, pricing, product) | `knowledge_search` | **Shipped** | most |
| **Web research** | `web_search` | **Shipped** (deep enrichment via connectors → build) | SDR research (2.3) |
| **Creative / web / collateral / meetings / email** | Figma, Wix, Google Drive, Google Calendar, Gmail (live MCP) | **✅ connectors exist** | Brand (1.5), Content (1.2), Events (1.8), Booking (2.5) |
| **Tamper-evident record** | the signed Merkle audit chain | **Shipped** | every send + CRM mutation + approval |

**The headline gaps** (no code): the systems-of-record + business workflow — CRM,
marketing automation (MAP), CPQ, CLM/e-sign, sales-engagement, conversation
intelligence, enrichment/intent, ads, CS & support platforms; plus lead scoring,
attribution, deal-desk workflow, forecast roll-up, commissions, territory/quota,
churn/health models, partner/PRM, and win-loss. These are §9 connectors + new packs.

## 2. How a GTM agent maps onto Lightwork

Same as the other suites: each agent is one
[`DomainProfile`](https://github.com/Daybreak-AI-Labs/Lightwork/blob/main/packages/maverick-core/maverick/domain.py) pack (compartment
+ persona + attenuating capability + tools + knowledge), governed by Layer A
(`governance.py`), the consent gate, and the signed audit chain. Two GTM specifics:

- **The customer-facing agents are personas over the shipped channels layer** — an
  AI SDR is a channel-bound agent with the `first_turn_disclosure` prepended and its
  `send` tool behind the consent gate. The pattern already runs in production for the
  support/assistant channels.
- **Outbound is the risk axis.** Where finance gates *money* and GRC gates *control
  changes*, GTM gates *what leaves the building to a human on the other side* —
  enforced by classifying every send/publish/spend tool high-risk and routing it
  through consent/governance.

---

## 3. The control model (cross-cutting)

### 3.1 The outbound gate (cardinal control)
Every external send, publish, post, or ad-spend is a high-risk action routed through
`governance.evaluate()` → `require_human` (or an automation tier, §4.1). Email/SMS/
social/voice tools are *already* `high` in `tool_risk.py`, so the gate is wiring, not
new classification. Agents draft; the send is gated.

### 3.2 Consent, permission & suppression (the hard floor)
The non-negotiable GTM control: **never contact a party who has opted out, is on a
do-not-contact/DNC list, or for whom there is no lawful basis.** A **suppression +
consent check** precedes *every* outreach action; unsubscribe/opt-out is honored
immediately and recorded. Covers CAN-SPAM, GDPR/ePrivacy (PECR), CASL, and TCPA/DNC
for calls/SMS. Lead-source **provenance** is checked too (bought/scraped lists are a
lawful-basis risk). Reuses the privacy suite's consent + PII primitives; this floor
cannot be lowered by any client profile (§4.2).

### 3.3 AI / bot disclosure
Customer-facing agents disclose they are AI where required (EU AI Act Art 50, CA SB
1001). **Shipped** — `compliance.py` `first_turn_disclosure` prepends it on the first
turn of every channel conversation; the GTM agents inherit it for free.

### 3.4 Pricing & discount authority (deal desk)
The maker-checker pattern from finance, applied to **margin**: a discount beyond a
floor, a non-standard term, or a price override routes to the deal desk / a human per
an **amount-aware approval matrix** (the same `require_human_above` policy the finance
suite needs — shared build). List-price quotes can auto-issue; everything below the
margin floor is gated.

### 3.5 Brand, claims & messaging governance
Published content, ad copy, and outbound messaging are reviewed before they go out:
**brand-voice** adherence, **FTC truth-in-advertising / substantiation** (no
unsupported claims), no unauthorized **competitive** claims, and regulated-industry
rules (HIPAA marketing, FINRA/SEC advertising) where the vertical applies. Content is
*drafted* by the agent and *approved* by a human (or an enablement-approved template)
before publish — the analogue of finance's "draft, don't post."

### 3.6 CRM & forecast integrity
Pipeline and forecast changes are **audited** (who/what/when on every stage move);
agents never fabricate activity; the **forecast submitted to finance is human-
committed** (it feeds the finance Forecasting agent). Light separation of duties: the
agent that advances a deal is not the one that "calls" the forecast, and **not** the
one that computes the rep's **commission** (which overlaps finance payroll).

### 3.7 Data privacy, provenance & residency
CRM holds customer/prospect PII → reuse `pii_detector`, egress/residency lock,
encryption at rest, and the **DSAR/erasure** path (a prospect is a data subject with
access/deletion rights, incl. CCPA sale/share opt-out). Lead data provenance is
recorded (§3.2).

### 3.8 Volume, deliverability & spend caps
Outreach respects per-channel **rate limits** (domain/sender reputation), per-run
**budget**, and **ad-spend caps** — reusing `rate_limiter`, `quotas`,
`net_concurrency`, `budget`. No agent can blast a list or overspend a campaign.

### 3.9 Contracts & signature
Agents assemble order forms and redline against the standard template, but **never
sign or counter-sign**; non-standard terms route to **legal/human** (overlaps the
legal domain + CLM).

### 3.10 The record
Every outbound message, CRM mutation, discount approval, and published asset is
written to the signed Merkle audit chain — the evidence trail for marketing-consent
audits, deal reviews, and dispute resolution.

---

## 4. Per-client customization — the dials

### 4.1 The automation ladder (per action class)
The L0–L4 ladder, with GTM examples:

| Level | GTM behaviour |
|---|---|
| **L0 Observe** | research accounts, score leads, recommend plays — no outreach |
| **L1 Draft** *(default for outbound)* | draft the email/post/quote; a human sends/publishes |
| **L2 Approve** | send/publish/quote after per-item human sign-off |
| **L3 Auto-under-threshold** | auto-send to *consented* contacts below a volume/risk floor; auto-quote at list price; auto-reply to inbound — exception-routed above the floor *(amount/volume-aware build)* |
| **L4 Straight-through** | always-on inbound chat (with AI disclosure) and opted-in nurture, autonomous within policy/budget; humans review samples |

Example: an SDR can be **L3** for follow-ups to opted-in inbound leads, **L2** for
cold outbound, and **L0** for anything to a net-new enterprise logo.

### 4.2 Hard floors — never auto, no matter the tier
The profile compiler refuses to lower these below a human gate:
- contacting a **suppressed / opted-out / no-lawful-basis** party (a hard **deny**);
- a **discount/term beyond the margin floor**;
- **signing a contract** or committing non-standard terms;
- **publishing a regulated or competitive claim** without review;
- **ad spend above the campaign cap**;
- **exporting or selling** customer data;
- **omitting AI disclosure** where it is legally required.

### 4.3 GTM motion
PLG / sales-led / channel-led / hybrid — sets which towers are primary. A PLG SaaS
leans on Marketing + Support + CS + product-qualified routing and a light AE tower;
an enterprise motion leans on SDR + AE + Deal Desk + Partnerships.

### 4.4 Discount-authority matrix
Per product/segment/currency: discount bands → required approver (rep / manager /
deal desk / VP / CFO) — the GTM DoA matrix, compiled to the amount-aware policy
(shared with finance §3.3 there).

### 4.5 Brand & messaging guardrails
Brand voice, prohibited claims, approved value props/competitive framing, tone, and
the approved-template library — a per-client knowledge source every content/outbound
agent must conform to (§3.5).

### 4.6 Consent & suppression rules per jurisdiction
Which regimes apply (CAN-SPAM / PECR / CASL / TCPA / CCPA), default opt-in vs opt-out,
cookie-consent posture, and the suppression sources — strictest-wins union (§7).

### 4.7 Channels, ICP & connectors
Which channels are enabled (and their rate caps), the ICP/segmentation definition,
and which CRM/MAP/CPQ/ads/CS systems back each agent.

### 4.8 The GTM Operating Profile
One signed, versioned bundle (intake produces, the wizard edits, rule 6) compiling to
capability + governance policy + consent config + enabled regimes + brand guardrails
+ the discount matrix — the GTM analogue of the Finance/GRC Operating Profiles.

### Council-added agents (from the adversarial review)

Five seats the council flagged — the three the brief named (Salesforce-dev, deliverability,
RevOps-data) were under-built. Full skills in [`agent-skills-catalog.md`](agent-skills-catalog.md).

- **Salesforce Admin / Developer Agent** *(Tower 4)* — Flow, Apex (triggers + async), SOQL/SOSL, governor limits, LWC, deployment (SFDX/unlocked packages/Gearset), security model, CPQ→Revenue Cloud. Splits the overloaded 4.4. **Status: Gap** (the seat that can actually "fix Salesforce errors").
- **Marketing-Ops / MarTech Engineer Agent** *(Tower 1)* — Marketo/HubSpot/MCAE build, lead scoring/lifecycle, GA4 + Consent Mode v2, server-side GTM, Meta CAPI/enhanced conversions, attribution. **Status: Gap** (1.7 is an analyst, not an ops engineer).
- **Deliverability / Email-Infrastructure Agent** *(Tower 1/2)* — SPF/DKIM/DMARC enforcement, BIMI/VMC, Google/Yahoo 2024 bulk-sender rules, Postmaster/SNDS, IP warmup. **Status: Gap** (smeared across 1.6/2.4 with no owner).
- **Revenue / GTM Data-Engineering Agent** *(Tower 4)* — warehouse-native GTM (Snowflake/BigQuery), reverse-ETL (Census/Hightouch), CDP (Segment), dbt funnel models, identity resolution. **Status: Gap** (the "RevOps engineering" the brief named).
- **Marketing-Privacy / Consent Agent** *(Tower 1)* — CMP (OneTrust), Global Privacy Control, CCPA Do-Not-Sell/Share, cookie consent, suppression sync. **Status: Gap.**

---

## 6. The Revenue Supervisor (Layer A)

Above the towers sits the **Revenue Supervisor** — the GTM instance of the oversight
control plane. It:

- **routes** a GTM task to the right tower agent across the funnel (a new inbound lead
  fans out to qualification → enrichment → SDR → AE), respecting compartment seals;
- **owns the outbound + approval queue** — every gated send, discount, publish, and
  contract lands here for human sign-off, with the consent/suppression check and the
  draft attached;
- **enforces the funnel SoD** — close ≠ forecast-call ≠ commission, by attenuated
  capability;
- **holds the brand/consent/discount policy** (§4) and the deliverability/spend caps.

Built on the shipped `governance.py` + `safety/consent.py` + the channels layer +
`fleet.py`; the operator console is the shared Layer-A gap (same as the other suites).

---

## 7. Compliance-regime packs (Layer B)

Strictest-wins union, same pluggable model. Several map to controls Lightwork already
enforces.

| Regime pack | Covers | Status |
|---|---|---|
| **EU AI Act Art 50 / CA SB 1001** | bot/AI disclosure | **Shipped** (`compliance.py`) |
| **CAN-SPAM** | US commercial email (opt-out, sender ID) | **Partial** (suppression check to build on the consent base) |
| **GDPR / ePrivacy (PECR)** | EU marketing consent + cookies + DSAR | **Partial** (DSAR/erase/egress shipped; marketing-consent ledger to build) |
| **CASL** | Canada anti-spam (express consent) | **Gap** |
| **TCPA / DNC** | US calls & SMS (consent, do-not-call) | **Gap** |
| **CCPA / CPRA** | sale/share opt-out, deletion | **Partial** (DSAR/erase shipped) |
| **FTC Act (truth-in-advertising, endorsement guides)** | substantiated claims, disclosed endorsements | **Gap** (claims-review workflow, §3.5) |
| **Call-recording consent** | one/two-party-consent states | **Gap** (gates 8.2) |
| **ADA / WCAG** | web/landing accessibility | **Gap** |
| **HIPAA marketing / FINRA-SEC advertising** | regulated-vertical messaging | **Gap** (vertical packs) |

---

## 8. Assessment templates to add

Append to the `assessment.py` engine (no new code — same as the other suites):

| New `type` | Owner | Framework |
|---|---|---|
| `outreach_compliance` | SDR (2.2), Nurture (1.6) | consent / CAN-SPAM / GDPR-PECR / CASL / TCPA pre-campaign check |
| `marketing_claim_review` | Content (1.2), PMM (1.4) | FTC truth-in-advertising / substantiation |
| `deal_desk_review` | Deal Desk (3.4) | discount / term / margin approval checklist |
| `lead_data_provenance` | Enrichment (2.3) | lawful source of a contact list |
| `churn_risk` | Churn (5.5) | account-health risk scoring |
| `win_loss` | CI (8.3) | deal-retro structured review |

Each becomes a `run_assessment` capability + a conversational assessor via the
existing `build_assessment_agent`.

## 9. Integrations catalog

Per CLAUDE.md rules 5 & 6, every connector ships a config knob + wizard toggle.

| System class | Vendors | Status | Used by |

**Knowledge sources:** the ICP/segmentation definition, brand & messaging guardrails,
the price book + discount policy, battlecards, product docs, the support KB, and the
suppression/consent rules.

## 10. Build sequence

Wrap the shipped engagement substrate first; gate everything outbound from day one.

1. **The outbound gate + consent/suppression hard floor (do this first).** Wire the
   suppression/consent check ahead of every send, the AI-disclosure prepend (shipped),
   per-channel rate caps, and the `require_human`/tier routing. Plus the
   `outreach_compliance` assessment template (§8). *No agent sends before this lands.*
2. **CRM connector (the system of record) + Support (6.1) + SDR (2.2) + Nurture
   (1.6)** on the channels layer — the highest-volume, substrate-ready agents.
3. **Deal Desk (3.4) + Quoting (3.3)** on the amount-aware policy (shared finance
   build) — margin protection; **brand/claims review** (§3.5) for Marketing.
4. **RevOps depth:** forecasting (4.1, feeds finance), CRM hygiene (4.4), routing
   (4.5), commissions (4.3, ties to payroll).
5. **CS & expansion** (Tower 5) on the CS-platform connector; **Marketing depth**
   (MAP/ads); **conversation intelligence + coaching** (8.2, with recording consent).
6. **Partnerships** (Tower 7, reusing vendor-risk) and the vertical regime packs.
7. **Wizard + dashboard** (rule 6): channel/connector setup, the GTM Operating
   Profile / discount matrix / brand-guardrail editor, and the outbound-approval console.

## 11. Honest caveats

- **Outward-facing means the blast radius is reputation and the law, not the books.**
  One bad send to the wrong list is a CAN-SPAM/GDPR event and a brand event. The
  consent/suppression floor (§3.2) and the outbound gate (§3.1) are not optional and
  cannot be tuned off.
- **Agents draft; humans send, publish, sign, and commit price.** No agent signs a
  contract, commits a non-standard term, approves its own discount, or publishes a
  regulated claim — those are gated human acts the suite drafts and audit-trails.
- **Disclose the AI; never impersonate a human** where the law requires disclosure
  (Art 50, CA SB 1001, two-party call-recording consent). It's shipped — keep it on.
- **The CRM is the system of record, not the world model.** `world_model.py` is
  working memory; the CRM connector is the source of truth, and forecast/commission
  numbers must reconcile to it (and the forecast is human-committed before it reaches
  finance).
- **Personalization ≠ surveillance.** Enrichment must respect lawful basis and data
  provenance; bought/scraped lists are a liability, not a shortcut (§3.2).
- **Don't game the funnel.** Attribution, forecast, and pipeline integrity (§3.6)
  matter precisely because these numbers drive comp and the finance forecast — the
  signed audit of every stage change is the backstop.
