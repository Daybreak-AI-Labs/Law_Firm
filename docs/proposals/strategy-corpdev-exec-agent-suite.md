# Strategy / Corporate Development / Executive agent suite

> **Status (June 2026):** counts and plans in this document are historical. The shipped catalog is 2,020 lint-clean agents across 53 suites with a full learning lifecycle — see [`docs/FEATURES.md`](../FEATURES.md).


**Status:** design / roadmap. Companion to the finance, IT-GRC, sales-GTM, HR, and
product-engineering suites; indexed in [`agent-suites-overview.md`](agent-suites-overview.md).
Builds on [`../enterprise/architecture.md`](../enterprise/architecture.md). ~31 agents (26 base + 5 council-added)
across seven towers.

> **The "top of the house" — heavily cross-cutting, MNPI-heavy.** This is the CEO/CSO/
> CorpDev/IR/Chief-of-Staff layer. It is the **leanest** suite by net-new agent count
> because so much is *cross-referenced* into the suites that already own a function:
> valuation & IR overlap **finance**, competitive intel & PR overlap **GTM**, ESG &
> ethics overlap **finance/GRC**. What is *unique* here is the **material** of the work —
> M&A, strategy, board matters, earnings — which is the company's most sensitive **material
> non-public information (MNPI)**. So the distinctive control is the **information barrier
> (ethical wall)**, and Lightwork already owns the exact primitive: the **Rung-2 compartment
> seal** (`quarantine.py`). A deal team and the board sit in sealed compartments; MNPI
> cannot cross to the rest of the fleet.

The cardinal rule for every agent below:

> *Agents research, analyze, model, and brief freely — but **strategic and capital
> decisions** (M&A, strategy, board matters, external disclosures) are made by **executives
> and the board**; **MNPI is walled into sealed compartments**; and nothing material is
> disclosed externally without the **disclosure-control (Reg FD)** gate.*

## 1. What's already shipped — the reuse map

| Existing capability | Module / surface | Status | Reused by |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Information barriers / ethical walls** | `quarantine.py` (Rung-2 seals) + `capability.py` (compartment scopes) | **Shipped** | MNPI handling (§3.1) — the keystone |
| **Deep research** | `/deep-research` skill, `web_search`, `tools/{newsapi_tool,semantic_scholar,arxiv,hackernews,reddit_tool,wikipedia,youtube}` | **Shipped** | Strategy (T1), CI (T3) |
| **Assessment engine** | `assessment.py` | **Shipped** | DD (2.2), the new templates (§8) |
| **Exec comms & scheduling** | the channels layer, `tools/{calendar_tool,calendly_tool,gmail_tool,msgraph_tool,teams_tool}` | **Shipped** | Chief of Staff (T6) |
| **Docs / briefs** | `tools/{pandoc_tool,knowledge,confluence_tool,notion}`, `gdrive_tool` | **Shipped** | Decision briefs (6.2), board (6.1) |
| **AI disclosure** | `compliance.py` (Art 50 / SB 1001) | **Shipped** | external-facing comms |
| **Decision gate + audit** | `governance.py`, `safety/consent.py`, the signed audit chain | **Shipped** | every gated disclosure/decision |
| **Valuation, IR, capital, SEC reporting** | the **finance** suite | cross-suite | M&A (2.3), IR (T5) |
| **Competitive intel, PR, partnerships** | the **GTM** suite | cross-suite | CI (T3), Corp Affairs (7.1) |
| **ESG / sustainability reporting, ethics/whistleblower** | the **finance** + **GRC** suites | cross-suite | ESG (7.3) |
| **Legal / contracts / regulatory** | the **legal** domain pack + GRC | cross-suite | Deal docs (2.4), Gov affairs (7.2) |

**The genuine gaps:** the *workflows* — M&A pipeline/diligence/PMI, board & governance
support, IR program, strategy-ops, PMO, and ESG/corporate-affairs orchestration — plus a
few connectors (board portal, PR/media, ESG-data, market-intel). The **controls** (ethical
walls, the decision gate, the audit trail) are shipped.

---

## 2. How a strategy/exec agent maps onto Lightwork

Each agent is a [`DomainProfile`](https://github.com/Daybreak-AI-Labs/Lightwork/blob/main/packages/maverick-core/maverick/domain.py) pack —
but here the **compartment seal is the point**, not an afterthought. A deal or board agent
is spawned into an **isolated compartment** (`quarantine`-sealable, capability-scoped) so
its MNPI never reaches the rest of the fleet, and it cannot reach back out. The research
and comms tools are shipped; the suite is the **sealed personas + the disclosure gates**
over them, with most analytical heavy-lifting delegated to the finance/GTM suites.

---

## 3. The control model (cross-cutting)

### 3.1 Information barriers (ethical walls) — the keystone
M&A deal teams and board work handle **MNPI**. Each is an **isolated compartment** — a
`quarantine`-sealable sector with a capability scope that excludes the rest of the fleet
and whose data the rest of the fleet cannot read. The wall is structural (the same Rung-2
seal that quarantines a compromised domain), not a policy promise. **Shipped primitive.**

### 3.2 Insider-trading prevention
MNPI never crosses the wall into a context that could act on it; trading-window/blackout
awareness is enforced; the audit chain records who accessed what deal data when. Agents
**never** trade (that's gated in the finance/treasury suite regardless).

### 3.3 Reg FD — no selective disclosure
Any **material** external disclosure is `require_human` and routed through the
disclosure-control gate (broad, non-selective). The earnings/IR agents draft; a human
discloses, simultaneously and broadly. Overlaps the finance SEC-reporting tower.

### 3.4 Board & governance confidentiality
Board materials live in a **sealed board compartment**; access is least-privilege
(directors/officers), and minutes/decisions are recorded immutably (the signed chain) —
the corporate-records and privilege posture.

### 3.5 Decisions are executive/board-owned
Strategy, M&A go/no-go, capital allocation, and board matters are **decided by humans**;
agents research, model, and brief. No agent commits the company to a deal, a strategy, or
a disclosure.

### 3.6 Conflicts of interest & independence
Recusal/independence is respected (a deal agent walled from a counterparty relationship);
conflicts are flagged, not navigated silently.

### 3.7 External-communication gate
Exec/corporate external comms (press, investor, policy) are gated and consistency-checked;
nothing material goes out un-approved (§3.3). AI disclosure where applicable.

### 3.8 The record
Every deal-data access, board action, disclosure decision, and brief is on the signed
Merkle audit chain — the insider-trading, Reg-FD, and corporate-governance evidence.

---

## 4. Per-client customization — the dials

### 4.1 The automation ladder
This suite skews **L0/L1** (research, model, brief) — its output informs human decisions,
it does not act. **L2+** is reserved for non-material administrative actions (scheduling,
internal-brief distribution). **No material decision or external disclosure is ever above
L1.**

### 4.2 Hard floors — never auto
- committing the company to an **M&A deal, strategy, or capital action**;
- any **material external disclosure** (Reg FD) or board action;
- moving **MNPI across an information barrier**;
- trading on, or enabling trading on, non-public information.

### 4.3 Company stage & posture
Public vs private (drives Reg FD / SEC / insider-trading intensity), M&A activity level
(buy-side/sell-side cadence), board composition, and the ESG/public-affairs footprint.

### 4.4 Information-barrier topology
Which compartments are walled (per active deal, the board, IR during blackout), who is
inside each wall, and the blackout/trading-window calendar.

### 4.5 Enabled towers & the Executive Operating Profile
Which towers (a startup runs Strategy + Chief-of-Staff + light IR; a public company runs
all seven), bundled into one signed, versioned profile (intake produces, wizard edits,
rule 6) compiling to capability + the wall topology + the disclosure gates.

### Council-added agents (from the adversarial review)

Five seats the council flagged — the two hardest, most deal-defining (M&A modeling, antitrust/
CFIUS) were falling between suites. Full skills in [`agent-skills-catalog.md`](agent-skills-catalog.md).

- **M&A Financial-Modeling Agent** *(Tower 2 — sealed)* — closes the Strat↔Finance gap: three-statement model, LBO mechanics (debt schedule/cash sweep/circularity), DCF/WACC, PPA, accretion/dilution, returns (IRR/MOIC), deal structuring. **Status: Gap** (neither suite owned it).
- **Antitrust / Merger-Clearance Agent** *(Tower 2)* — HSR thresholds + the 2024 HSR rule, 2023 Merger Guidelines, second requests, EU/UK & global merger control, **CFIUS**, gun-jumping. Awareness/flagging for counsel. **Status: Gap** (was "flag for counsel" with no skill).
- **Activist-Defense / Shareholder-Engagement Agent** *(Tower 5)* — 13D/G monitoring (2024 deadlines), proxy season/ISS-Glass Lewis, say-on-pay, 10b5-1. **Status: Gap.**
- **JV / Alliance / BD Agent** *(Tower 2)* — non-M&A inorganic growth: JV structuring, strategic alliances, licensing economics. **Status: Gap.**
- **Transaction-Tax / Structuring Agent** *(Tower 2 — sealed)* — 338(h)(10)/336(e), NOLs & §382, step-up, tax-free reorg (§368) — cross-ref finance tax. **Status: Gap.**

---

## 6. The Executive Supervisor (Layer A)

Above the towers sits the **Executive Supervisor** — the strategy/exec instance of the
oversight control plane, and the most authority-laden because it governs MNPI and external
disclosure. It:

- **enforces the information barriers** — holds the parent capability and the wall topology;
  spawns deal/board agents into sealed compartments and can `quarantine` a deal sector
  instantly;
- **owns the disclosure-control queue** — every material external disclosure (Reg FD), board
  action, and deal commitment lands here for human/officer/board approval;
- **routes** strategic work while keeping walled work walled (a deal agent cannot pull in a
  general-research agent that would carry MNPI out);
- **records** every MNPI access and disclosure decision to the signed chain.

Built on the shipped `quarantine.py` + `capability.py` + `governance.py` + `safety/consent.py`
+ the audit chain; the operator console is the shared Layer-A gap.

---

## 7. Compliance & governance packs (Layer B)

| Pack | Covers | Status |
|---|---|---|
| **Insider trading / MNPI (Reg) + information barriers** | ethical walls, MNPI handling, blackout windows | **Partial** (seals/capability **shipped**; the blackout-calendar + wall topology to wire) |
| **Reg FD (selective disclosure)** | broad, simultaneous material disclosure | **Partial** (decision gate shipped; the disclosure-control workflow) |
| **SEC reporting (S-K/S-X) + corporate governance** | filings, board records | cross-suite (**finance** SEC tower) |
| **ESG/sustainability (CSRD/ESRS, ISSB)** | sustainability disclosure | cross-suite (**finance** ESG vertical + GRC) |
| **Antitrust / HSR (M&A)** | merger review awareness | **Gap** (flag for counsel) |
| **Lobbying / public-affairs disclosure** | gov-relations registration/reporting | **Gap** |
| **AI disclosure** | external-facing comms | **Shipped** (`compliance.py`) |

---

## 8. Assessment templates to add

Append to the `assessment.py` engine (no new code):

| New `type` | Owner | Framework |
|---|---|---|
| `ma_screen` | Target sourcing (2.1) | acquisition-thesis fit / screen |
| `dd_checklist` | Due diligence (2.2) | financial/legal/tech/commercial DD coverage |
| `strategic_fit` | Strategy (1.3) | build/buy/partner option scoring |
| `disclosure_control` | Earnings/IR (5.2) | Reg FD materiality / selective-disclosure check |
| `board_readiness` | Board (6.1) | board-meeting / governance-pack readiness |

Each becomes a `run_assessment` capability + a conversational assessor via
`build_assessment_agent`.

---

## 9. Integrations catalog

materials (sealed), prior filings, the cap table, competitive battlecards, and the policy/
public-affairs library.

## 10. Build sequence

Lead with the fast wins on shipped substrate and the wall, then the workflows.

1. **The information-barrier topology + disclosure gate (do this first).** Wire the wall
   topology onto `quarantine`/`capability` (deal/board compartments, blackout calendar) and
   the Reg-FD disclosure gate onto `governance`. Plus the M&A/board assessment templates (§8).
2. **Fast wins on shipped tools:** Chief-of-Staff (6.3) on the scheduling/comms connectors,
   Strategy Research (1.1) on `/deep-research`, Decision-Brief (6.2), Competitive Intel
   (3.x) reusing GTM.
3. **Corp Dev / M&A** (Tower 2) inside sealed compartments — DD (2.2) reusing the finance/
   legal/GRC assessors; valuation (2.3) reusing finance.
4. **IR & Capital** (Tower 5) on the finance IR/reporting towers; **Board support** (6.1)
   on a board-portal connector.
5. **PMO** (Tower 4) on the PM connectors; **Corp Affairs & ESG** (Tower 7) reusing GTM PR
   + finance ESG; the antitrust/lobbying packs.
6. **Wizard + dashboard** (rule 6): wall-topology / blackout-calendar / disclosure-gate
   editor, the Executive Operating Profile, and the disclosure/board-approval console.

---

## 11. Honest caveats

- **MNPI is the whole game.** The information barrier (ethical wall) is the load-bearing
  control; a deal or board agent that leaks MNPI to the general fleet is a securities-law
  event. The wall is the shipped Rung-2 seal — but the *topology* (who's inside which wall,
  blackout windows) must be configured and enforced, not assumed.
- **Agents inform; executives and the board decide.** No agent commits the company to a
  deal, a strategy, a capital action, or a board decision — those are human/board acts the
  suite drafts and audit-trails.
- **Reg FD is a hard floor.** Nothing material goes out selectively or un-approved; the
  disclosure-control gate is mandatory for a public company.
- **This suite mostly orchestrates the others.** Valuation/IR → finance; CI/PR → GTM;
  ESG/ethics → finance/GRC; deal docs → legal. The value here is the executive altitude +
  the walls, not re-implementing those analyses.
- **Counsel territory.** Insider trading, Reg FD, antitrust/HSR, and lobbying disclosure
  are legal determinations; the suite provides the controls, evidence, and drafts, and
  routes the judgment to qualified counsel.
