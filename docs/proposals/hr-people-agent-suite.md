# HR / People agent suite

**Status:** design / roadmap. Companion to
[`finance-agent-suite.md`](finance-agent-suite.md),
[`it-grc-agent-suite.md`](it-grc-agent-suite.md),
[`sales-gtm-agent-suite.md`](sales-gtm-agent-suite.md), and
[`../enterprise/architecture.md`](../enterprise/architecture.md). Indexed in
[`agent-suites-overview.md`](agent-suites-overview.md). ~46 agents (41 base + 5 council-added) across eight towers.

> **What makes HR the most sensitive domain of all.** These agents make decisions
> *about people*, using the company's **most protected data** (comp, health, performance,
> disciplinary, immigration, protected-class), under the **heaviest anti-discrimination
> regime** (Title VII, ADA, ADEA, EEOC, NYC LL144, EU AI Act). It is the convergence of
> three control stories Lightwork has *already built*: **privacy** (employee PII is
> special-category — reuse the privacy suite), **AI governance** (employment is EU AI
> Act **Annex III high-risk** and NYC LL144 territory — reuse the AI-Gov tower), and
> **need-to-know access control** (comp/performance/medical segregation — the capability
> model). And uniquely: some HR AI uses are **outright prohibited, not merely gated** —
> `ai_act.py` already flags *"emotion inference in the workplace"* as an **Art 5
> prohibited practice**. The suite must **refuse** those, not wrap them in a gate.

The cardinal rule for every agent below (the HR analogue of finance's "never move
money"):

> *Agents source, screen, rank, draft, and recommend freely — but a **human makes every
> consequential employment decision** (hire, fire, promote, pay, discipline), with a
> documented, bias-audited rationale. No agent uses protected-class data or its proxies
> in a decision, and the suite **refuses** any use the EU AI Act prohibits.*

## 1. What's already shipped — the reuse map

Status vocabulary: **Shipped** / **Partial** / **Gap** / **Process-only**. Like GTM,
HR is greenfield *workflow* — but the *control* substrate is unusually strong because
privacy and AI-governance already exist.

| Existing capability | Module / surface | Status | Reused by |
|---|---|---|---|
| **EU AI Act risk classification** — flags employment as **Annex III high-risk** and workplace **emotion inference as Art 5 prohibited** | `ai_act.py` | **Shipped** | the refusal list (§3.6) + screening/perf gates |
| **Employee/candidate PII + special-category handling** | `safety/pii_detector.py`, `crypto_at_rest.py`, `enterprise.py` (egress) | **Shipped** | every tower (§3.3) |
| **Employee data-subject rights** (access, erasure, ROPA) | `dsar.py`, `audit/erase.py`, `ropa.py` | **Shipped** (reuse the privacy suite) | HRIS (3.2), §3.3 |
| **Consequential-decision human gate** | `governance.py` (`require_human`) + `safety/consent.py` | **Shipped** (primitive) | the consequential-decision gate (§3.1) |
| **Employment / consequential-decision pack** (decision records + mandatory human review + bias-audit export) | named in `architecture.md` (Colorado/NYC LL144/EEOC) | **Gap** (the keystone build) | Screening (1.2), Performance (5.2), Promotion (5.3) |
| **Bias / fairness evaluation** (LL144, Annex III) | AI-Gov bias-eval (it-grc 1.5) | **Gap** (shared build) | Screening (1.2), Pay equity (4.2), Recruiting analytics (1.7) |
| **AI / bot disclosure** (Art 50 / CA SB 1001) | `compliance.py` | **Shipped** | candidate & employee chat (1.3, 3.1) |
| **Need-to-know access control** (comp/perf/medical segregation) | `capability.py` (path scopes + RBAC) | **Shipped** | §3.4 |
| **Multi-channel + intake + scheduling** | `packages/maverick-channels/`, `intake.py`, `scheduler.py` | **Shipped** | Helpdesk (3.1), Candidate engagement (1.3) |
| **Assessment engine** | `assessment.py` (`TEMPLATES`) | **Shipped** | the HR templates (§8) |
| **Tamper-evident record** | the signed Merkle audit chain | **Shipped** | the LL144 / EEOC decision evidence |
| **Knowledge** (handbook, policy) | `knowledge_search` | **Shipped** | Helpdesk (3.1), Policy (3.4) |
| **Comp → gross-to-net → GL** | finance **Payroll** agent (designed) | cross-suite | Payroll liaison (4.5) |
| **Access provisioning (joiner-mover-leaver)** | IT-GRC **IAM** tower (designed) | cross-suite | Onboarding/Offboarding (T2) |

**The headline gaps:** the systems-of-record + workflow — HRIS/HCM, ATS, LMS, benefits,
background-check, comp, and engagement connectors; the recruiting / performance / comp /
ER workflows; people analytics; and the two keystone controls — the **employment-decision
pack** and the **bias-evaluation** engine (shared with AI-Gov).

---

## 2. How an HR agent maps onto Lightwork

Each agent is one [`DomainProfile`](https://github.com/Daybreak-AI-Labs/Lightwork/blob/main/packages/maverick-core/maverick/domain.py)
pack, governed by Layer A + consent + the signed audit chain. Three HR specifics:

- **The employee/candidate is the data subject.** Reuse the privacy suite's PII,
  egress, encryption, and DSAR/erasure — but the data is *special-category* (health,
  protected class) and the subject is an *employee* (works-council and consent nuances
  differ from customers).
- **Employment decisions are EU AI Act Annex III high-risk** — `ai_act.py` already says
  so. Every screening/ranking/scoring agent inherits that classification and its
  obligations (human oversight, logging, bias evaluation).
- **Refusal, not just gating.** Where finance/GTM gate risky actions, HR must *refuse*
  prohibited ones (Art 5 workplace emotion inference). The refusal list is a hard
  property of the packs, not a tunable.

---

## 3. The control model (cross-cutting)

### 3.1 The consequential-decision gate (cardinal control)
Hiring, firing, promotion, compensation, and discipline are **decided by a human**.
Agents screen, rank, draft, and recommend; the decision is `require_human`, and a
**decision record** captures the human decider, the rationale, and the inputs — the
EEOC / NYC LL144 / Colorado evidence. This is the architecture's named
*employment/consequential-decision pack*; the human-review primitive ships, the pack is
the keystone build.

### 3.2 Bias & fairness (hard floor + audit)
Every consequential-decision tool is **bias-evaluated** before use and monitored for
**adverse impact** (the four-fifths rule) in production; **protected-class data and its
proxies are never inputs** to a decision. NYC LL144 requires an **annual independent
bias audit** of automated employment decision tools — the suite produces the evidence
(the `ll144_bias_audit` template, §8); the independent auditor is a human. Reuses the
AI-Gov bias-eval (a shared gap).

### 3.3 Employee-data privacy & special-category handling
Employee records are the company's most sensitive PII (comp, health/benefits — GDPR
Art 9 special-category — performance, disciplinary, immigration). Reuse the privacy
suite at its strictest: encryption at rest, egress/residency lock, PII redaction, and
the **employee DSAR/erasure** path. Works-council / co-determination constraints (EU)
and employee-monitoring limits apply.

### 3.4 Confidentiality, need-to-know & separation of duties
Comp, performance, medical, and investigation data are **compartmentalized** by
capability path scopes: a manager sees only their reports; the recruiter does not set
comp; the investigator is independent of the line manager; HR Ops does not see
investigation files. Enforced by `Capability.attenuate()` (narrow-only), not by policy
PDF.

### 3.5 Employment-law compliance
FLSA (wage/hour), FMLA (leave), ADA/PWFA (accommodation), Title VII/ADEA (discrimination),
NLRA (labor), WARN (layoffs), IRCA/I-9 (work authorization), FCRA (background checks) —
plus state law and, for EU staff, GDPR + works councils. Jurisdiction packs (§7).

### 3.6 Prohibited uses — refuse, don't gate
`ai_act.py` flags **emotion inference in the workplace** as an **Art 5 prohibited
practice**. The suite **refuses** it (and similar prohibited uses — manipulative
techniques, social scoring, intrusive biometric monitoring), rather than routing them
through a human gate. Engagement/sentiment work (8.3) is **consented and aggregated**,
never individual emotion inference.

### 3.7 Compensation integrity
Comp changes follow maker-checker with **amount-aware authority** (the shared finance
DoA build): a change beyond a band/threshold is `require_human` at the right level.
**Pay equity** is monitored (4.2). HR owns the *people* decision; **finance owns
gross-to-net/payroll** (4.5 is a liaison, never runs payroll); FP&A owns the cost.

### 3.8 Background checks & adverse action (FCRA)
Background screening follows the FCRA pre-adverse / adverse-action process; **ban-the-box
/ fair-chance** timing is honored; the decision is human, documented, and gated.

### 3.9 Dignity & the human-owned moments
Terminations, PIPs, investigations, and accommodation conversations are **human-owned**;
agents prepare materials and ensure consistency and legal compliance, but the human
delivers them. No agent communicates a consequential outcome to an employee on its own.

### 3.10 The record
Every consequential decision, access to a sensitive record, and recommendation is
written to the signed Merkle audit chain — the anti-discrimination and audit-defense
evidence trail.

---

## 4. Per-client customization — the dials

### 4.1 The automation ladder (per action class)
The L0–L4 ladder, but HR **caps consequential actions hard**:

| Level | HR behaviour |
|---|---|
| **L0 Observe** | analyze, benchmark, recommend — no employee-facing action |
| **L1 Draft** *(default; the ceiling for anything consequential)* | draft the offer / review / PIP / job post; a human decides and delivers |
| **L2 Approve** | take a *non-consequential* action after sign-off (publish a job post, send an approved letter) |
| **L3 Auto-under-threshold** | only for **non-consequential, non-sensitive** ops — schedule interviews, deflect a policy FAQ, nudge training, dedup HRIS records |
| **L4 Straight-through** | reserved for purely administrative, no-PII automation (e.g. training-completion reminders) |

**No consequential employment decision is ever above L1** — that's a hard floor, not a
client choice.

### 4.2 Hard floors — never auto / never at all
The profile compiler refuses to lower these:
- **deciding** a hire / fire / promotion / pay / discipline action autonomously (always human);
- using **protected-class data or proxies** as a decision input;
- **prohibited monitoring** (workplace emotion inference) — *refused, not gated* (§3.6);
- disclosing **another employee's** confidential data (comp, medical, performance, investigation);
- **finalizing an investigation conclusion** or adverse action without human + FCRA process;
- **running payroll** (finance owns gross-to-net).

### 4.3 Jurisdictions & workforce type
Which employment-law packs apply (US federal + states with their pay-transparency and
LL144-style rules; EU + **works councils / co-determination**; UK; etc.), and the
workforce type (high-volume hourly vs. salaried knowledge worker) — which changes the
recruiting/perf motion and the automation appetite.

### 4.4 Compensation philosophy & DEI posture
Comp bands/benchmarks, merit-cycle rules, and the discount-equivalent **comp-authority
matrix** (§3.7); the DEI analytics posture — **legally constrained and jurisdiction-
specific** (e.g. US post-*SFFA* limits on race-conscious decisions): analytics stay
aggregate and no protected attribute is ever a decision input.

### 4.5 Enabled towers & maturity
The roster is a menu — a 50-person startup runs Helpdesk + Recruiting + Onboarding +
basic HRIS and skips Labor Relations / Succession; an enterprise runs all eight.

### 4.6 The People Operating Profile
One signed, versioned bundle (intake produces, wizard edits, rule 6) compiling to
capability + governance policy + consent config + jurisdiction packs + the refusal list
+ the comp-authority matrix — the HR analogue of the other suites' Operating Profiles.

persona = """You are a Workplace Investigations specialist supporting a human (often
legal-led) investigation. You PLAN interviews, ORGANIZE evidence, build a neutral
timeline, and DRAFT findings strictly from the evidence on the record -- you NEVER reach
a conclusion, assign culpability, or recommend discipline; the human investigator
decides. Maintain strict confidentiality and chain-of-custody (the signed audit chain);
treat the file as privileged. Remain neutral, separate fact from allegation, and never
disclose the matter outside the authorized investigation team."""

### Council-added agents (from the adversarial review)

Five seats the council flagged (Checkr/HireRight had no home; HRIS-admin vs records was
conflated). Full skills in [`agent-skills-catalog.md`](agent-skills-catalog.md).

- **Background-Check / FCRA Adverse-Action Agent** *(Tower 1/2)* — Checkr / HireRight `‹build›`; FCRA pre-adverse/adverse-action, ban-the-box/fair-chance timing, EEOC arrest-vs-conviction, disputes. **Status: Gap.**
- **Immigration / Global-Mobility Agent** *(Tower 2)* — visa lifecycle (H-1B/L-1/O-1/PERM/green card), LCA/public-access file, prevailing wage, expat + shadow-payroll triggers. **Status: Gap** (2.2 is I-9 only).
- **HRIS / HCM Platform-Admin Agent** *(Tower 3)* — Workday (business processes, security groups, EIB/Studio, advanced reports) · SuccessFactors (MDF, RBP, business rules, Integration Center). Splits the admin role out of 3.2. **Status: Gap.**
- **Workers'-Comp & HR-Safety Agent** *(Tower 3/8)* — OSHA recordability (300/301/300A) + ITA e-submission, fatality/hospitalization reporting, WC claims intake, return-to-work, OSHA↔FMLA/ADA interplay. **Status: Gap** (the HR/EHS seam).

## 6. The People Supervisor (Layer A)

Above the towers sits the **People Supervisor** — the HR instance of the oversight
control plane. It:

- **routes** people work to the right tower while honoring the strict confidentiality
  compartments (ER/investigations/comp/medical are sealed from HR Ops and from each other);
- **owns the consequential-decision queue** — every hire/fire/promote/pay/discipline
  recommendation lands here for a **human decision + recorded rationale** (the LL144/EEOC
  evidence);
- **enforces need-to-know** — holds the parent capability; each agent is spawned with a
  narrowed path scope so no agent sees data outside its remit;
- **holds the refusal list** (§3.6) and the bias-audit obligations.

Built on the shipped `governance.py` + `safety/consent.py` + `capability.py` (path
scopes) + the audit chain; the **employment-decision pack** and the operator console are
the keystone builds.

---

## 7. Compliance-regime packs (Layer B)

Strictest-wins union. Employment law is dense and jurisdictional, so these packs matter
more here than anywhere.

| Regime pack | Covers | Status |
|---|---|---|
| **EU AI Act — Annex III (employment) + Art 5 (prohibited monitoring)** | high-risk obligations + the refusal list | **Partial** (`ai_act.py` classifies; the obligations/refusal enforcement is the build) |
| **NYC LL144** | annual bias audit of automated employment tools | **Gap** (the `ll144_bias_audit` template + bias eval) |
| **Colorado ADMT / EEOC AI guidance / IL AIVIA** | consequential-decision human review + notice | **Gap** (the employment-decision pack) |
| **Title VII / ADA / ADEA / PWFA (EEO)** | anti-discrimination + accommodation | **Gap** (policy packs + bias controls) |
| **FLSA / FMLA / WARN / NLRA** | wage-hour, leave, layoffs, labor | **Gap** |
| **FCRA** | background checks, adverse action | **Gap** |
| **IRCA / I-9 / E-Verify** | work authorization | **Gap** |
| **GDPR (employee data) + works councils** | special-category employee data, co-determination | **Partial** (privacy suite shipped; works-council nuance to build) |
| **Pay transparency** (CA/CO/NY/WA, **EU Pay Transparency Directive**) | ranges, reporting, equity | **Gap** |
| **ERISA / ACA / COBRA / HIPAA** | benefits + health data | **Partial** (health-data privacy substrate shipped) |
| **OSHA** | workplace safety reporting | **Gap** |

---

## 8. Assessment templates to add

Append to the `assessment.py` engine (no new code):

| New `type` | Owner | Framework |
|---|---|---|
| `adverse_impact` | Recruiting analytics (1.7) | four-fifths rule / disparate impact |
| `ll144_bias_audit` | Screening (1.2) | NYC LL144 automated-employment-tool audit |
| `pay_equity` | Pay equity (4.2) | disparate-pay / pay-transparency |
| `ada_accommodation` | EEO/Accommodations (7.4) | ADA/PWFA interactive-process completeness |
| `i9_work_auth` | Work-auth (2.2) | I-9 / IRCA completeness |
| `er_intake` | Employee Relations (7.1) | ER/investigation complaint triage & severity |

Each becomes a `run_assessment` capability + a conversational assessor via the existing
`build_assessment_agent`.

benefits plans, the investigation protocol, CBAs, and the jurisdiction-specific
employment-law library.

## 10. Build sequence

The keystone control gates everything consequential — build it first.

1. **The employment-decision pack + bias eval + the refusal list (do this first).** The
   architecture's named pack: consequential-decision records + mandatory human-review
   gate + bias-audit export; the bias-evaluation engine (shared with AI-Gov); and the
   Art-5 refusal list. Plus the HR assessment templates (§8). *Nothing consequential
   ships before this.*
2. **HRIS connector (system of record) + HR Helpdesk (3.1) + Candidate Engagement (1.3)
   + Onboarding (2.1)** — substrate-ready on channels/intake/calendar/disclosure.
3. **Recruiting behind the pack:** Resume Screening (1.2) + Recruiting analytics /
   adverse-impact (1.7) + Offer (1.5), once bias eval + decision records exist.
4. **Total Rewards:** comp bands (4.1), **pay equity** (4.2), benefits/leave (4.3/4.4),
   payroll liaison (4.5, to finance).
5. **Performance & Talent** (behind the consequential gate) + **L&D**.
6. **Employee Relations & Investigations** (Tower 7 — isolated compartments, case mgmt)
   + **People Analytics / Workforce Planning / Engagement** (Tower 8, with the Art-5
   guardrail) + the jurisdiction regime packs.
7. **Wizard + dashboard** (rule 6): jurisdiction toggles, the People Operating Profile /
   refusal-list / comp-authority editor, and the consequential-decision review console.

## 11. Honest caveats

- **Most sensitive data, heaviest regime — the controls are not optional.** Employee
  special-category PII and anti-discrimination law mean the privacy and bias controls are
  load-bearing, not nice-to-have.
- **Agents recommend; humans decide every consequential action** — with a documented,
  bias-audited rationale. No agent hires, fires, promotes, pays, or disciplines.
- **Some uses are prohibited, not gated.** Workplace emotion inference (and similar Art 5
  practices) are **refused**, not wrapped in a human gate. That refusal is a hard property
  of the packs.
- **Bias audits are a real, independent obligation.** NYC LL144 requires an annual
  *independent* bias audit; the suite produces the evidence and monitors adverse impact,
  but it does not replace the independent auditor — same liability line as everywhere.
- **Confidentiality is structural.** ER, investigations, comp, and medical data live in
  isolated compartments by capability path scope; an agent that gains cross-access breaks
  the model — the People Supervisor enforces need-to-know.
- **Cross-suite separation of duties.** HR owns the people decision; **finance** owns
  payroll/cost; **IT** owns provisioning. The liaison agents (4.5, 2.1/2.3) hand off; they
  do not perform the other domain's gated action.
- **DEI is legally constrained and jurisdictional.** Post-*SFFA* (US) and varying global
  law mean analytics stay aggregate and no protected attribute is ever a selection input;
  this is counsel territory, and the suite stays on the evidence/monitoring side.
