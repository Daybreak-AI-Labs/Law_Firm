# Product & Engineering agent suite

**Status:** design / roadmap. Companion to the finance, IT-GRC, sales-GTM, and HR
suites; indexed in [`agent-suites-overview.md`](agent-suites-overview.md). Builds on
[`../enterprise/architecture.md`](../enterprise/architecture.md) and
[`agent-factory.md`](agent-factory.md). ~46 agents (40 base + 6 council-added) across eight towers.

> **Product & Engineering is the inverse of every other suite.** Finance and HR are
> greenfield *workflow*; here, **Lightwork itself is a software-engineering agent**, so
> the engineering core — the recursive coding loop, sandboxed execution (7 backends),
> code review, the test-driven verifier, the SWE-bench eval harness, VCS/CI tools — is
> the most mature capability in the whole platform. And the connector layer is
> astonishingly complete: the `tools/` directory already ships **Jira, Linear, Asana,
> ClickUp, Trello, Notion, Confluence** (PM), **GA4, Mixpanel, PostHog, Plausible**
> (product analytics), **Datadog, Sentry, PagerDuty, Vercel, Cloudflare** (DevOps),
> `a11y` (accessibility), diagramming, and the full coding/VCS toolchain. **The tools
> are nearly all there; what's missing is the role-specialized agent personas (domain
> packs) that wield them, and a few workflow gaps.** This suite is *"wrap the richest
> existing toolset in role personas."*

The cardinal rule for every agent below (the P&E analogue of "never move money"):

> *Agents research, design, write, test, and review freely **in the sandbox** — but every
> execution is sandbox-mediated, code ships only through the **verifier + review** gates,
> a **human approves every merge to a protected branch, release, and production deploy**,
> product decisions (what to build) are human-owned, and **an agent never modifies its own
> runtime, safety, or controls without explicit human authorization.***

That last clause is unique to this suite: **Lightwork builds Lightwork**, so
self-modification is a first-class hard floor (see the shipped "disable self-edit writes
by default" control).

## 1. What's already shipped — the reuse map

This is the most "Shipped"-heavy reuse map of any suite.

|---|---|---|---|
| **The coding kernel** (recursive loop, edit formats, patch/AST edits, code exec) | `agent.py`, `coding_mode.py`, `edit_format.py`, `tools/{apply_patch,ast_edit,str_edit,code_exec,repo_map,dep_graph,test_impact}.py` | **Shipped** | Software Eng (T3) |
| **Sandboxed execution (7 backends + egress layer)** | `sandbox/{docker,podman,firecracker,kubernetes,devcontainer,ssh,local}.py` (7 backends) + `network_policy.py` (egress) | **Shipped** | every agent that runs code (§3.1) |
| **Code review** | `reviewer.py` + `/code-review` skill + GitHub Copilot review | **Shipped** | Code Review (3.2) |
| **Security review** | `/security-review` skill (+ IT-GRC AppSec, T7 there) | **Shipped** | review gate (§3.3) |
| **Test-driven verifier (anti-cheat)** | `verifier.py` | **Shipped** | the ship gate (§3.2), Test authoring (3.5) |

| **AppSec, AI-model governance, SRE/incident** | IT-GRC suite Towers 7 / 1 / 10 & 6 | cross-suite | T5, T6 (don't duplicate) |

**The genuine gaps:** the **role personas themselves** (PM, designer, data engineer as
domain packs — the tools exist, the agents don't), product-analytics-as-insight and
customer-feedback synthesis workflow, design-system governance, formal QA test-management,
ML model registry / MLOps depth, and **DORA / engineering-metrics**.

---

## 2. How a P&E agent maps onto Lightwork

Each agent is one [`DomainProfile`](https://github.com/Daybreak-AI-Labs/Lightwork/blob/main/packages/maverick-core/maverick/domain.py)
pack — but here the pack is mostly **tool selection + persona over a shipped toolset**,
not new infrastructure. The Software Engineering tower (T3) is essentially the existing
coding agent with role-scoped capabilities; the other towers bind the already-shipped
PM/design/analytics/DevOps tools to specialist personas.

Two specifics:
- **The engineering agents are the most autonomous in the platform** (they write and run
  code), so the controls are about *what ships and what they're allowed to touch*, not
  about whether they can act.
- **Lightwork builds Lightwork.** Agents work on this very codebase, so self-modification,
  the verifier/review/CI gates, and human-approved merges are not abstract — they're the
  controls that keep an agent from changing its own safety substrate.

---

## 3. The control model (cross-cutting)

### 3.1 Sandbox-mediation (CLAUDE.md rule 4)
All execution goes through `sandbox.exec()` — never a raw `subprocess`. The 7 backends
(local → devcontainer → docker/podman → firecracker/kubernetes → ssh) + `network_policy`
give the operator the isolation/egress posture they need. **Shipped.**

### 3.2 The ship gate — verifier + review
Code ships only after the **test-driven verifier** (anti-test-cheating) passes *and* a
**code review** (and security review where warranted) clears. Agents draft PRs; they do
not merge unverified code. **Shipped** (`verifier.py`, `reviewer.py`, the skills).

### 3.3 Human-approved merge / release / deploy (maker-checker for code)
Merging to a protected branch, cutting a release, and **deploying to production** are
`require_human` (governance + consent). Agents prepare; humans approve. Production deploy
is a **hard floor** (§4.2).

### 3.4 Least privilege over the codebase & infra
Capability **path scopes** bound which repos/dirs an agent may touch and **host scopes**
which infra/registries it may reach; CI secrets are never exposed to agent context
(secret redaction). A docs agent can't touch infra; a data agent can't touch the kernel.

### 3.5 Supply-chain, secrets & licenses
Dependencies are license-scanned (`license_scan.py`) and (via IT-GRC AppSec, T7)
CVE/SBOM-checked; secrets are detected/redacted; MCP/plugins are pinned (`mcp_registry`
`pin_sha256`). Don't duplicate the AppSec tower — reuse it.

### 3.6 Self-modification hard floor (unique to this suite)
An agent must not modify its **own runtime, safety controls, or kernel** without explicit
human authorization — `tools/self_edit.py` ships with **writes disabled by default**.
Changes to `safety/`, `capability.py`, `governance.py`, the audit chain, or the sandbox
require a human and the full review gate. Lightwork can improve Lightwork, but never
silently weaken its own guardrails.

### 3.7 Product decisions are human-owned
*What* to build, prioritization, and tradeoffs are decided by humans (PM/leadership);
agents research, model, and recommend. The roadmap is not the agent's to set.

### 3.8 Budget, audit & provenance
Long-running engineering work respects `Budget`; every change, merge, and deploy is on the
signed audit chain; AI-generated code is marked/traceable (provenance).

---

## 4. Per-client customization — the dials

### 4.1 The automation ladder (per action class)

| Level | Engineering behaviour |
|---|---|
| **L0 Observe** | analyze the codebase, review, recommend — no changes |
| **L1 Draft** *(default)* | open a PR / draft a spec; a human reviews & merges |
| **L2 Approve** | merge after human approval (the verifier + review must pass) |
| **L3 Auto-under-threshold** | auto-merge **low-risk** changes that pass CI + review — dependency bumps, docs, formatting, generated code in non-protected paths |
| **L4 Straight-through** | reserved; autonomous within a sealed, non-production scope (e.g. an internal tool's own repo) with post-hoc review |

### 4.2 Hard floors — never auto
- **production deployment** (always human);
- **self-modification** of the kernel / `safety/` / `capability` / `governance` / sandbox / audit (§3.6);
- **merge to a protected branch** without the verifier + review gate;
- adding a **strong-copyleft or critical-CVE dependency**;
- **disabling a CI/safety gate** or weakening a sandbox/egress policy;
- exfiltrating **source or secrets** beyond the allowed hosts.

### 4.3 Tech stack, repo topology & CI/CD
Languages/frameworks, monorepo vs polyrepo, branch-protection rules, the CI/CD system
(GitHub Actions / GitLab CI — both shipped), test/coverage thresholds, and which paths are
**auto-mergeable** (drives the L3 surface).

### 4.4 Enabled towers, sandbox posture & connectors
Which towers (a pure-software shop may skip Data/ML; a data team leans on T6), the sandbox
backend + network policy, and which PM/analytics/DevOps connectors are wired.

### 4.5 The Engineering Operating Profile
One signed, versioned bundle (intake produces, wizard edits, rule 6) compiling to
capability (path/host scopes) + governance policy + the auto-merge rules + the
self-modification floor + CI gates — the P&E analogue of the other suites' profiles.

- **Job:** Research spikes, feasibility studies, throwaway PoCs in the sandbox.
- **Connects to:** the sandbox, `web_search`, the reasoning strategies (debate/ToT).
- **Capability:** experiment-in-sandbox + `report_findings`. PoCs don't ship without the gate.
- **Status:** **Shipped/Partial** (the kernel does this).

#### 8.3 Technology-Evaluation Agent
- **Job:** Library/framework/vendor evaluation, build-vs-buy, license/risk screening.
- **Connects to:** `web_search`, `license_scan.py`, `dep_graph`.
- **Capability:** evaluate + `draft_tech_eval`. No adoption decision.
- **Status:** **Partial**.

### Council-added agents (from the adversarial review)

Six seats the council flagged — several with **shipped tooling but no persona** (the exact
"tools there, agent missing" gap). Full skills in [`agent-skills-catalog.md`](agent-skills-catalog.md).

- **Mobile Engineering Agent** *(Tower 3)* — `tools/android.py` + `tools/ios_sim.py` already ship. Swift/SwiftUI, Kotlin/Compose, React Native/Flutter; Fastlane/Gradle; mobile security (keychain, cert pinning). App-store release = hard-floor human. **Status: Gap** (tools shipped, agent absent).
- **API Design & Contract Agent** *(Tower 3/8)* — `tools/openapi_runner.py` ships. OpenAPI 3.1, GraphQL/federation, gRPC/protobuf, AsyncAPI, versioning/deprecation, contract testing (Pact). **Status: Gap.**
- **Database Engineering / DBA Agent** *(Tower 6)* — owns the **Oracle 23ai standup** + data modeling, query tuning, migrations (Flyway/Liquibase/Alembic), HA/PITR, and the shipped NoSQL connectors (`dynamodb`/`mongodb`/`redis`/`elasticsearch`). **Status: Gap** (DBA depth was mis-scoped into IaC).
- **Platform Engineering Agent** *(Tower 5/7)* — Backstage/IDP, golden paths, ephemeral envs, secrets (Vault/SOPS), FinOps. **Status: Gap.**
- **LLM-Application / Prompt-Engineering Agent** *(Tower 6)* — RAG pipelines, prompt engineering, eval (RAGAS/LLM-judge), guardrails, latency/cost. Distinct from classical ML (6.3/6.4) — Lightwork is itself an AI product. **Status: Gap.**
- **Performance / Load-Engineering Agent** *(Tower 4)* — k6/Gatling/JMeter/Locust, profiling (eBPF/Pyroscope), Core Web Vitals, capacity testing. **Status: Gap** (no non-functional-perf owner).

## 6. The Engineering Supervisor (Layer A)

Above the towers sits the **Engineering Supervisor** — the P&E instance of the oversight
control plane, and the most natural fit because the platform's **recursive swarm /
orchestrator already coordinate engineering sub-agents**. It:

- **routes & decomposes** a product goal across the towers (PM spec → design → implement →
  test → review → release), via `task_graph`/`orchestrator`/`swarm`;
- **owns the merge/release/deploy queue** — every protected-branch merge, release, and
  production deploy lands here for human approval, with the diff + verifier + review attached;
- **enforces the self-modification floor** — holds the parent capability; agents are spawned
  with path scopes that *exclude* the safety substrate unless a human authorizes;
- **holds the CI/auto-merge policy** and the budget.

Built on the shipped `swarm.py`/`orchestrator.py`/`task_graph.py` + `governance.py` +
`verifier.py` + `capability.py`; the operator console (the merge/deploy approval UI) is
the shared Layer-A gap.

---

## 7. Standards & governance packs (Layer B)

Engineering's "regimes" are standards + the org's own gates.

| Pack | Covers | Status |
|---|---|---|
| **Coding standards / style** | language/style/lint conventions, review rubric | **Partial** (`reviewer.py` + house style; per-client rubric to wire) |
| **Test & coverage policy** | verifier gates, coverage thresholds, eval gates | **Shipped** (`verifier.py`, `benchmarks/`) |
| **Branch protection / merge policy** | who/what can merge, required checks, auto-merge surface | **Partial** (governance + VCS; the merge-policy compiler) |
| **Secure-SDLC** | secret/SAST/SCA gates, threat modeling | **Partial** (reuse IT-GRC AppSec T7) |
| **Self-modification policy** | what an agent may change about itself | **Shipped** (`self_edit` off by default) — the keystone |
| **Accessibility (WCAG)** | a11y gates on UI | **Partial** (`a11y` tool) |
| **Data/ML governance** | data contracts, model cards, AI risk | **Gap** (reuse GRC + AI-Gov) |
| **Open-source / license policy** | allowed licenses, contribution policy | **Shipped** (`license_scan.py`) |

---

## 8. Assessment templates to add

Append to the `assessment.py` engine (no new code):

| New `type` | Owner | Framework |
|---|---|---|
| `tech_design_review` | Architecture (8.1) | design-doc / ADR readiness checklist |
| `release_readiness` | Release (4.5) | go/no-go release gate |
| `prod_readiness` | DevOps (5.x) | operational-readiness review (SLOs, runbooks, rollback) |
| `dependency_risk` | Supply chain (5.5) | license + CVE + maintenance health |
| `data_pipeline_quality` | Data (6.2) | data-contract / quality checklist |
| `accessibility_audit` | a11y (2.4) | WCAG conformance |

Each becomes a `run_assessment` capability + a conversational assessor via
`build_assessment_agent`.

## 9. Integrations catalog

Per CLAUDE.md rules 5 & 6, every connector ships a config knob + wizard toggle. **Most of
this is already shipped** (§1) — the rare ✅-heavy catalog.

| System class | Vendors | Status | Used by |
|---|---|---|---|
| **VCS / CI** | GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI | **✅ shipped** | T3, T5 |
| **PM / issue tracking** | Jira, Linear, Asana, ClickUp, Trello, Notion, Confluence, Airtable | **✅ shipped** | T1 |
| **Product analytics** | GA4, Mixpanel, PostHog, Plausible | **✅ shipped** | 1.5, 6.5 |
| **Design** | Figma (Code Connect), diagram, a11y, Wix | **✅ shipped/live** | T2 |
| **Observability / DevOps** | Datadog, Sentry, PagerDuty, Vercel, Cloudflare, Lambda, S3 | **✅ shipped** | T5 |
| **Data / compute** | SQL, pandas, notebooks, spreadsheet, HuggingFace, sandbox (7 backends) | **✅ shipped** | T6, T3 |
| **Docs** | pandoc, LaTeX, PDF, Confluence, Notion | **✅ shipped** | 7.1 |
| **Cloud platforms (deep IaC/CSPM)** | AWS, Azure, GCP | ◻ build (P2) | 5.2 |
| **Data warehouse / orchestration** | Snowflake, BigQuery, dbt, Airflow | ◻ build (P2) | T6 |
| **ML platform** | MLflow, SageMaker, Vertex | ◻ build (P3) | 6.3, 6.4 |
| **Feature flags / experimentation** | LaunchDarkly, Statsig | ◻ build (P3) | 1.5, 5.3 |

**Knowledge sources:** the codebase + `repo_map`, engineering standards/style guide, the
architecture docs (`docs/`), ADRs, the product strategy, and runbooks.

## 10. Build sequence

The kernel ships; lead with role personas + the gates, then close the workflow gaps.

1. **Role-persona packs over the shipped toolset (immediate).** Domain packs for the SWE
   (3.1), Code Review (3.2), PM (1.x), and Codebase-Q&A (7.4) agents — they're persona +
   tool-scope over the kernel and the shipped PM/analytics connectors. Plus the merge/
   release gates wired to `governance` + the **self-modification floor** asserted.
2. **The Engineering Supervisor** (§6) on the existing swarm/orchestrator — the merge/
   release/deploy approval queue and path-scope enforcement.
3. **QA + DevOps depth:** eval/release-readiness (4.3/4.5), CI/CD (5.1), observability
   (5.4) on the shipped tools; the assessment templates (§8).
4. **Design & UX** on Figma/a11y; **Product analytics & feedback synthesis** (1.5/1.6).
5. **Data & ML** (T6) on warehouse/ML connectors; **DORA metrics** (7.3).
6. **Vendor/cloud-deep connectors** (AWS/Azure/GCP IaC, warehouses, ML platforms).
7. **Wizard + dashboard** (rule 6): repo/CI setup, the Engineering Operating Profile /
   auto-merge / self-modification editor, and the merge/deploy console.

---

## 11. Honest caveats

- **Don't rebuild the kernel.** Tower 3 is the existing coding agent; the work is
  role-scoping + gating it, not reimplementing it. Same for the shipped PM/analytics/
  DevOps connectors — wrap them in personas, don't re-author them.
- **Agents draft; humans merge, release, and deploy.** No agent merges to a protected
  branch, cuts a release, or deploys to production on its own — those are gated human acts,
  and **production deploy is a hard floor**.
- **Self-modification is the load-bearing control.** Because Lightwork builds Lightwork, an
  agent changing its own runtime/safety/kernel without human authorization would undermine
  every other suite's controls. `self_edit` ships off by default — keep it that way and
  route any safety-substrate change through a human + the full review gate.
- **Verifier + review are not optional.** "Get to green by disabling the gate" is the
  failure mode the anti-test-cheating verifier exists to stop; the gate is the product.
- **Product decisions stay human.** Agents inform *what* to build; they don't decide it.
- **Reuse the neighbors.** AppSec → IT-GRC T7; SRE/incident → IT-GRC T10/6; model
  governance → IT-GRC T1; ESG/data-governance → GRC. Cross-reference, don't fork.
