# Operations / Supply Chain agent suite — the COO's office

**Status:** design / roadmap. Companion to the finance, IT-GRC, sales-GTM, HR,
product-engineering, strategy/exec, and legal suites; indexed in
[`agent-suites-overview.md`](agent-suites-overview.md). Builds on
[`../enterprise/architecture.md`](../enterprise/architecture.md). ~39 agents (33 base + 6 council-added) across eight
towers.

> **Operations is the only suite where agents act on the *physical* world.** Every other
> suite produces drafts, analyses, or digital actions; here an agent's recommendation can
> become a **purchase order** (money *and* goods), a **production release**, a **dispatched
> shipment**, or — at the sharp end — a command to **physical equipment** that affects
> **worker safety**. `ai_act.py` already classifies *"critical infrastructure (safety
> components)"* as **Annex III high-risk**, and the physical-action tools (`home_assistant`,
> `computer`, `android`) are already **high-risk**. So the distinctive control is the
> **physical-action gate** ("never move atoms" — the operations analogue of finance's "never
> move money"), and — uniquely — **safety is a refusal, not a gate**: an agent never controls
> a safety-critical system or overrides an interlock, full stop (parallel to HR's Art 5
> refusal and the prohibited-monitoring line).

The cardinal rule for every agent below:

> *Agents plan, optimize, schedule, and recommend freely — but any action with a **physical
> or irreversible real-world consequence** (placing a PO, releasing production, dispatching a
> shipment, actuating equipment) requires human authorization; agents **never control
> safety-critical equipment or override a safety control**; and **worker safety and
> regulatory compliance always override efficiency**.*

## 1. What's already shipped — the reuse map

Mostly greenfield *workflow*, but the **control substrate and the cross-suite overlaps** are
strong (procurement/inventory live in finance; supplier risk in GRC).

| Existing capability | Module / surface | Status | Reused by |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Physical-action gate** | `governance.py` (`require_human`) + `safety/consent.py`; physical tools already `high`-risk in `tool_risk.py` | **Shipped** | §3.1 — the cardinal control |
| **EU AI Act critical-infrastructure classification** | `ai_act.py` ("critical infrastructure (safety components)" = Annex III) | **Shipped** | the safety-refusal list (§3.2) |
| **Procurement / inventory / cost / AP / fixed-assets / lease** | the **finance** suite (Cost-Accounting & Inventory 1.9, Procurement T6, AP 1.2, FA 1.5, Lease 1.10) | cross-suite | Procurement (T2), Inventory (5.3), Facilities (T7) |
| **Supplier / third-party risk** | the **GRC** vendor-risk tower + `assessment.py` `_VENDOR_RISK` | cross-suite (**shipped** template) | Supplier risk (2.4) |
| **Trade / customs / sanctions / export control** | the **legal** (6.3) + **finance** (AML) suites | cross-suite | Customs & trade (5.5) |
| **EHS / environmental / sustainability reporting** | **GRC** + the **finance** ESG vertical | cross-suite | EHS (T8) |
| **Incident response / business continuity** | IT-GRC (SecOps 6.3, DR 10.4) | cross-suite | Incident & emergency (8.3) |
| **Commerce / order management** | `tools/shopify_tool` (+ GTM/finance OTC) | **Partial** | Fulfillment (5.4) |
| **IoT / device control** | `tools/home_assistant_tool` (consumer-grade; industrial is build + gated) | **Partial** | maintenance/MES (heavily gated) |
| **Ops analytics** | `tools/{pandas_query,sql_query,spreadsheet}` | **Shipped** | planning & quality analytics |
| **Supplier/ops comms & intake** | the channels layer, `intake.py` | **Shipped** | supplier comms, ops helpdesk |
| **Audit / budget / least privilege** | the signed chain, `budget.py`, `capability.py` | **Shipped** | every agent |

**The genuine gaps:** the operations *systems of record* — ERP/MRP, WMS, TMS, MES,
CMMS (maintenance), QMS (quality), SRM (supplier), EHS, demand-planning, and **industrial
IoT/SCADA** — plus the **physical-action gate enforcement** and the **safety-refusal list**.

---

## 2. How an operations agent maps onto Lightwork

Each agent is a [`DomainProfile`](https://github.com/Daybreak-AI-Labs/Lightwork/blob/main/packages/maverick-core/maverick/domain.py) pack.
The defining specific: **the capability envelope separates *planning* (digital, freely
automatable) from *acting* (physical, gated or refused).** A planning agent gets read +
optimize tools; a shop-floor or dispatch agent's physical-effect tools are on `deny_tools`
or behind `require_human`, and any **safety-critical** actuation is simply **not in the
grant at all** (refused by construction, not gated).

Procurement, inventory, and supplier risk are **mostly owned by finance/GRC** — this suite
plans and executes the *physical* flow and cross-references those for the money/risk side.

---

## 3. The control model (cross-cutting)

### 3.1 The physical-action gate (cardinal control)
Any action with a **physical or irreversible real-world consequence** — place a PO, release
a production/work order, dispatch a shipment, move inventory, actuate equipment — is
`require_human` (or a tier, §4.1). Agents plan and stage; humans authorize the commitment of
money-and-atoms. Physical tools are already `high`-risk, so the gate is wiring.

### 3.2 Safety is a refusal, not a gate
Agents **never** control safety-critical equipment, override a safety interlock, or disable a
safety control — these are **refused** (not in the capability grant), parallel to HR's Art-5
refusals. `ai_act.py` flags safety-component control as Annex III high-risk; for autonomous
agents the suite treats direct safety-critical actuation as out of scope. **Worker safety
overrides efficiency** in every tradeoff.

### 3.3 Spend & commitment authority (procurement)
POs and purchase commitments follow the **amount-aware DoA matrix** (the shared finance
primitive) and the **3-way match** (cross-ref finance AP); reorder limits cap autonomous
replenishment. No agent commits spend beyond its tier.

### 3.4 Inventory & quantity integrity
No over/under-ordering; quantities reconcile to the ERP/WMS system of record; cycle-count and
adjustment integrity (cross-ref finance cost-accounting/inventory). Phantom inventory and
unreconciled adjustments are flagged.

### 3.5 Quality, traceability & recalls
Quality holds, NCR/CAPA, and **lot/serial traceability** are enforced; a **product recall is
human-led** (a safety/regulatory event) — the agent assembles scope and traceability, a human
executes.

### 3.6 Regulatory & supply-chain ethics
OSHA (safety), EPA/environmental, DOT (transport), customs/trade + sanctions (cross-ref legal/
finance), and industry rules (FDA/food, etc.); plus supply-chain ethics — **forced-labor /
modern-slavery** screening and conflict minerals (cross-ref GRC vendor risk).

### 3.7 Resilience & continuity
Supplier and single-source risk, disruption response, and physical business continuity
(cross-ref IT-GRC). Critical-path and concentration risk surfaced, not hidden.

### 3.8 The record
Every PO, production release, dispatch, inventory move, quality decision, and safety incident
is on the signed Merkle audit chain — the traceability, recall-defense, and OSHA/EPA evidence.

---

## 4. Per-client customization — the dials

### 4.1 The automation ladder
Operations can automate **digital planning** higher than finance/legal, but **physical action
is hard-capped**:

| Level | Operations behaviour |
|---|---|
| **L0 Observe** | analyze, forecast, optimize, recommend |
| **L1 Draft** *(default for physical commitments)* | stage the PO / schedule / dispatch plan; a human releases |
| **L2 Approve** | execute a physical commitment after human sign-off |
| **L3 Auto-under-threshold** | autonomous **digital + low-risk replenishment** — auto-reorder within limits, route optimization, schedule balancing, below a value/quantity floor |
| **L4 Straight-through** | reserved for purely digital, no-physical-risk optimization (e.g. a plan refresh) |

### 4.2 Hard floors — never auto / never at all
- **controlling safety-critical equipment or overriding a safety interlock** — *refused, not gated* (§3.2);
- **releasing production / dispatching / actuating equipment** above the tier (human);
- a **PO/commitment beyond the DoA matrix**;
- **executing a recall** (human-led) or shipping product on **quality hold**;
- handling **hazmat** or anything affecting **worker safety**;
- exceeding **environmental-permit** limits.

### 4.3 Industry & physical footprint
Discrete vs process manufacturing vs distribution vs services; sites/plants/warehouses/fleet;
which towers apply (a distributor skips Manufacturing; a services firm skips most of T3/T5).

### 4.4 Authority matrices & reorder policy
The PO/spend DoA tiers, autonomous-reorder limits, the safety-stock/service-level targets, and
the quality-hold rules.

### 4.5 Systems & the Operations Operating Profile
Which ERP/WMS/TMS/MES/CMMS/QMS back each agent, the safety-refusal list, and the gates —
bundled into one signed, versioned Operations Operating Profile (intake produces, wizard
edits, rule 6).

## 6. The Operations Supervisor (Layer A)

Above the towers sits the **Operations Supervisor** — the ops instance of the oversight
control plane, and the one with the most **real-world** authority. It:

- **owns the physical-commitment queue** — every PO, production release, dispatch, inventory
  adjustment, and recall lands here for human authorization, with the plan + impact attached;
- **enforces the safety-refusal floor** — holds the parent capability and ensures no spawned
  agent's grant includes safety-critical actuation; an unsafe condition triggers escalation;
- **routes the physical flow** end-to-end (plan → source → make → store → move → deliver)
  while keeping the gates between digital planning and physical action;
- **records** every physical commitment and safety/quality event to the signed chain.

Built on the shipped `governance.py` + `safety/consent.py` + `capability.py` + `ai_act.py`
(critical-infrastructure classification) + the audit chain; the operator console is the shared
Layer-A gap.

## 7. Compliance & governance packs (Layer B)

| Pack | Covers | Status |
|---|---|---|
| **OSHA / worker safety** | safety programs, recordkeeping, the refusal floor | **Partial** (refusal floor on `ai_act`/capability; EHS workflow to build) |
| **EU AI Act — critical infrastructure (Annex III)** | safety-component control as high-risk/out-of-scope | **Shipped** (classification) |
| **EPA / environmental** | permits, emissions, waste | **Gap** (cross-ref GRC/legal) |
| **DOT / transportation** | carrier, hazmat, hours-of-service | **Gap** |
| **Customs / trade / export control / sanctions** | classification, duties, screening | cross-suite (**legal** + **finance**) |
| **ISO 9001 (quality) / industry (FDA, etc.)** | quality system, traceability, recalls | **Gap** |
| **Supply-chain ethics (forced labor, conflict minerals)** | modern-slavery, due diligence | **Partial** (reuse GRC vendor risk) |
| **Procurement authority (DoA) + 3-way match** | spend control | **Partial** (governance + finance AP) |

## 8. Assessment templates to add

Append to the `assessment.py` engine (no new code):

| New `type` | Owner | Framework |
|---|---|---|
| `supplier_risk_ops` | Supplier risk (2.4) | resilience / single-source / forced-labor screen |
| `safety_audit` | EHS (8.1) | OSHA / hazard / JSA readiness |
| `quality_audit` | Quality (4.x) | ISO 9001 / process-control checklist |
| `recall_readiness` | Compliance & Recall (4.4) | traceability / recall-execution readiness |
| `bcp_supply` | Resilience (3.7/8.3) | supply-chain business-continuity / disruption |
| `env_compliance` | Environmental (8.2) | permit / emissions applicability |

Each becomes a `run_assessment` capability + a conversational assessor via
`build_assessment_agent`.

**Knowledge sources:** the production/quality SOPs, the **safety program + OSHA standards**,
the price agreements + procurement policy, the BOM/routings, lease agreements, and the
environmental-permit register.

## 10. Build sequence

Lead with the digital-planning value + the physical/safety gates, then the systems of record.

1. **The physical-action gate + the safety-refusal list (do this first).** Wire
   `require_human` on every physical commitment, assert the safety-critical refusal (no
   actuation/override in any grant), and the procurement DoA + 3-way match (with finance).
   Plus the ops assessment templates (§8). *No agent moves atoms or touches a safety control
   before this.*
2. **Digital-planning fast wins** on the shipped analytics: Demand Planning (1.1), Inventory
   Optimization (1.4), and route/load optimization (5.1) at L0/L3 (recommend / within limits).
3. **Procurement (T2)** on the ERP/SRM connectors (shared with finance) — PO + 3-way match.
4. **Logistics & Inventory (T5)** on WMS/TMS; **Quality (T4)** on QMS — incl. recall readiness.
5. **Manufacturing (T3)** + **Maintenance (T6)** on MES/CMMS — **read/telemetry first**,
   physical execution gated, safety-critical refused.
6. **EHS (T8)** + **Facilities (T7)**; the environmental/DOT/customs regime packs (cross-ref
   GRC/legal).
7. **Wizard + dashboard** (rule 6): site/system setup, the Operations Operating Profile /
   reorder-authority / safety-refusal editor, and the physical-commitment console.

## 11. Honest caveats

- **Agents move information; humans move atoms.** Placing a PO, releasing production,
  dispatching, and adjusting inventory are gated human acts — the agent plans and stages.
- **Safety is a refusal, not a gate.** An agent never controls safety-critical equipment or
  overrides an interlock; that is out of scope, not a permission to request. Worker safety
  overrides efficiency in every tradeoff, and EU AI Act flags safety-component control as
  high-risk for exactly this reason.
- **Physical systems are unforgiving.** A wrong reorder ties up cash; a wrong production or
  dispatch wastes material and time; a wrong equipment command can hurt someone. The gates
  exist because the real world doesn't have an undo.
- **This suite executes the physical flow; finance/GRC own the money and risk.** Procurement
  spend, inventory valuation, supplier risk, ESG, and trade compliance live in finance/GRC/
  legal — cross-reference them; don't fork.
- **Industry changes everything.** Discrete vs process manufacturing vs distribution vs
  services have very different towers; enable what the physical footprint needs, and treat
  regulated industries (food/pharma/chemicals) as vertical overlays with counsel.
