# Legal agent suite — the General Counsel's office

**Status:** design / roadmap. Companion to the finance, IT-GRC, sales-GTM, HR,
product-engineering, and strategy/exec suites; indexed in
the agent-suites overview. Extends the shipped
[`legal.toml`](https://github.com/Daybreak-AI-Labs/Lightwork/blob/main/packages/maverick-core/maverick/domains/legal.toml) starter pack into
a full suite. ~36 agents (31 base + 5 council-added) across eight towers.

> **Legal is horizontal — it touches every other suite — and uniquely risky for AI.** A
> Legal agent that invents a case citation is not a bug, it's the failure mode that has
> already gotten lawyers *sanctioned* (the "fake citations" line of cases). So the
> distinctive control here is **citation integrity** — every authority verified against a
> real source (CourtListener is already wired) or marked unverified, never fabricated.
> Two more controls define the suite: **"research and analysis, not legal advice"** (a
> qualified attorney owns every position — the unauthorized-practice-of-law line), and
> **attorney-client privilege / conflicts** — which map onto the *same* `quarantine.py`
> ethical-wall primitive the Strategy suite uses for MNPI. The starter pack already
> encodes the spine; this fleshes out the office.

The cardinal rule, generalized verbatim from `legal.toml` and applied to every agent below:

> *Agents research, draft, review, and flag freely — **citing authorities precisely** — but
> they provide **research and analysis, not legal advice**; a qualified **attorney owns every
> legal position**, and nothing is **filed, served, signed, or sent to a third party**
> without explicit attorney confirmation in the same turn.*

## 1. What's already shipped — the reuse map

| Existing capability | Module / surface | Status | Reused by |
|---|---|---|---|
| **The legal research persona** (cite precisely, not legal advice, human-confirm) | `domains/legal.toml` | **Shipped** | Tower 1; the spine of every pack |
| **Case-law / citation source** | CourtListener (live MCP) | **Shipped** | Research (1.1), Citation verification (1.2) |
| **Deep research** | `/deep-research`, `web_search`, `tools/semantic_scholar` | **Shipped** | T1, T6 |
| **Document handling** | `tools/{pdf_reader,ocr,pandoc_tool,confluence_tool,notion}`, `gdrive_tool` | **Shipped** | Contracts (T2), E-discovery (4.2) |
| **Privilege / conflict ethical walls** | `quarantine.py` (Rung-2 seals) + `capability.py` (compartment scopes) | **Shipped** | privilege & conflicts (§3.3/§3.4) — the keystone |
| **"Not legal advice" + human-confirm gate** | `legal.toml` persona + `governance.py` + `safety/consent.py` | **Shipped** | the legal-act gate (§3.5) |
| **Assessment engine** | `assessment.py` | **Shipped** | the legal templates (§8) |
| **Intake / channels** | `intake.py`, the channels layer | **Shipped** | Legal intake & triage (8.3) |
| **AI disclosure + audit chain** | `compliance.py`, the signed Merkle chain | **Shipped** | external comms; the record |
| **Regulatory / compliance, vendor DPAs** | the **GRC** suite | cross-suite | Regulatory (6.1), Privacy law (7.2) |
| **Employment law** | the **HR** suite (Tower 7 there) | cross-suite | Employment law (7.1) |
| **Privacy law (DPIA/ROPA/DSAR/DPA)** | the **privacy** suite | cross-suite | Privacy law (7.2) |
| **SEC, contracts, SOX, equity** | the **finance** suite | cross-suite | Securities (3.3), Equity (3.4) |
| **M&A deal docs, board, antitrust/HSR** | the **strategy/exec** suite | cross-suite | Corporate (T3), Antitrust (6.2) |
| **Order forms, marketing claims (FTC)** | the **GTM** suite | cross-suite | Contracts (2.x) |

**The genuine gaps:** the legal *workflow + systems of record* — CLM (contract drafting/
review/repository), e-discovery & legal-hold, matter management, outside-counsel/e-billing,
IP management, entity management — plus the **citation-verification pipeline** (CourtListener
is wired; "verify *every* cite or mark it unverified" is the enforcement to build) and the
**conflicts-check** system.

---

## 2. How a legal agent maps onto Lightwork

Each agent is a [`DomainProfile`](https://github.com/Daybreak-AI-Labs/Lightwork/blob/main/packages/maverick-core/maverick/domain.py) pack
that **inherits the `legal.toml` spine** (cite precisely, not legal advice, human-confirm)
and adds a practice-area persona + tools. Two specifics:

- **Privilege and conflicts are sealed compartments**, exactly like Strategy's MNPI walls:
  a matter (especially litigation/M&A) runs in a `quarantine`-sealable compartment so
  privileged work-product cannot leak (waiving privilege) and conflicted matters are
  walled from each other.
- **Citation integrity is enforced at the tool layer**, not trusted to the model — a draft
  with an unverifiable authority is flagged, never shipped (§3.2).

---

## 3. The control model (cross-cutting)

### 3.1 Research and analysis, not legal advice (UPL)
Agents draft memos, contracts, briefs, and analyses; a **qualified attorney reviews and
owns** every legal position. The agent never holds itself out as giving legal advice or as
a lawyer. This is the `legal.toml` persona, enforced everywhere.

### 3.2 Citation integrity (the distinctive control)
**Every legal authority is verified against a real source** (CourtListener / the research
DBs) before it appears in a draft; an authority that cannot be verified is **flagged as
unverified and excluded**, never fabricated. This is the #1 legal-AI failure mode — the
suite treats a hallucinated citation as a hard error, not a stylistic slip. *Pipeline to
build on the shipped CourtListener connector.*

### 3.3 Attorney-client privilege & work-product
Privileged materials live in **sealed compartments** (`quarantine` + capability scope);
they are never disclosed outside the privilege (which would waive it), and the privilege
status of every document is tracked. Same Rung-2 seal Strategy uses for MNPI.

### 3.4 Conflicts of interest & ethical walls
A **conflicts check** precedes taking on a matter; conflicted matters are **walled** from
each other (separate compartments, no cross-access). Recusal is enforced structurally, not
promised.

### 3.5 No filing / serving / signing / sending without an attorney
Filing with a court/agency, serving a party, signing/executing a document, and sending to a
third party are `require_human` (attorney) — maker-checker for legal acts. A hard floor
(§4.2).

### 3.6 Legal hold & spoliation prevention
When a legal hold is in effect, the relevant materials **cannot be deleted or altered** —
a hard floor that overrides retention/erasure (note the tension with privacy's right-to-
erasure: a legal hold wins). Holds are issued, tracked, and released by humans.

### 3.7 Confidentiality & jurisdiction
Client/matter confidentiality (reuse PII/egress/encryption); every analysis names the
**governing jurisdiction and law** (law varies by jurisdiction — an un-scoped answer is
flagged).

### 3.8 The record
Every draft, citation check, privilege determination, conflicts check, and legal act is on
the signed Merkle audit chain — the malpractice-defense and ethics evidence trail.

---

## 4. Per-client customization — the dials

### 4.1 The automation ladder
Legal skews **L0/L1** (research, draft, flag) — output informs an attorney's decision.
**L2+** is reserved for non-substantive ops (intake routing, repository filing). **No legal
position, filing, or external send is ever above L1.**

### 4.2 Hard floors — never auto
- **filing / serving / signing / sending** to a court, agency, or third party;
- **waiving attorney-client privilege** (any disclosure outside the wall);
- presenting a **legal position as final/authoritative** without attorney review;
- **a fabricated or unverified citation** in any output;
- taking a matter with an **unresolved conflict**;
- **deleting or altering material under a legal hold** (spoliation).

### 4.3 Jurisdictions & practice areas
Which jurisdictions' law applies (US federal + states, EU, UK, multi-national), and which
**towers/practice areas** are enabled (a startup runs Contracts + Legal Ops + Research; an
enterprise GC runs all eight).

### 4.4 In-house vs. firm, playbooks & risk tolerance
In-house (business-counsel posture) vs. law-firm (client-matter posture); the **contract
playbook** (standard positions + fallbacks) the review agents enforce; and the risk
tolerance / escalation thresholds.

### 4.5 Matter & conflict-wall topology + the Legal Operating Profile
Which matters are walled (litigation, M&A, investigations), who is inside each wall, the
conflicts list — bundled into one signed, versioned Legal Operating Profile (intake
produces, wizard edits, rule 6) compiling to capability + the wall topology + the legal-act
gates + the playbook.

## 5. The roster — eight towers

~31 agents. For each: **Job**, **Connects to**, **Capability**, **Controls**, **Status**.
Heavy cross-references to GRC/HR/privacy/finance/strategy (don't duplicate). Representative
packs are TOML.

court, year) and quote the controlling text. VERIFY every citation against a real source
(CourtListener / the research database) before you use it; if you cannot verify an
authority, mark it [UNVERIFIED] and do not rely on it -- never invent a case, statute, or

THIS company's playbook; for every deviation, cite the playbook position, explain the risk
in business terms, and propose the fallback language. Redline precisely. You DRAFT and
redline for a human attorney to review, negotiate, and approve -- you never sign, execute,
or commit to terms. Flag (do not silently accept) any non-standard liability, indemnity,

## 6. The General Counsel Supervisor (Layer A)

Above the towers sits the **GC Supervisor** — the legal instance of the oversight control
plane. It:

- **enforces privilege & conflict walls** — holds the parent capability and the matter-wall
  topology; spawns litigation/M&A/investigation agents into sealed compartments, and runs
  the conflicts check (8.5) before opening a matter;
- **owns the legal-act queue** — every filing, service, signature, external send, and
  privilege/legal-hold decision lands here for **attorney** approval;
- **enforces citation integrity** — no draft leaves a tower with an unverified authority;
- **records** every legal act, citation check, and privilege call to the signed chain.

Built on the shipped `quarantine.py` + `capability.py` + `governance.py` + `safety/consent.py`
+ CourtListener + the audit chain; the operator (attorney-review) console is the shared
Layer-A gap.

---

## 7. Compliance & governance packs (Layer B)

| Pack | Covers | Status |
|---|---|---|
| **Professional responsibility / UPL** | not legal advice, attorney ownership, competence/candor | **Shipped** (the `legal.toml` persona + the legal-act gate) |
| **Citation integrity** | verified authority, no fabrication | **Partial** (CourtListener shipped; the verify pipeline) |
| **Privilege & work-product** | privilege walls, no waiver | **Shipped** (`quarantine` seals) |
| **Conflicts / ethical walls** | conflicts check, matter isolation | **Partial** (seal primitive shipped; conflicts DB) |
| **Litigation hold / e-discovery (FRCP)** | hold, preservation, spoliation, production | **Gap** (the hold-vs-erasure build) |
| **Jurisdiction / governing law** | scope every answer to a jurisdiction | **Partial** (persona; per-client jurisdiction packs) |
| **Securities / corporate** | filings, disclosure, governance | cross-suite (**finance** + **strategy**) |
| **Employment / privacy / regulatory / antitrust / trade** | the substantive bodies of law | cross-suite (**HR / privacy / GRC / strategy**) |

## 8. Assessment templates to add

Append to the `assessment.py` engine (no new code):

| New `type` | Owner | Framework |
|---|---|---|
| `contract_risk_review` | Contracts (2.2) | playbook deviation / risk-term checklist |
| `conflicts_check` | Conflicts (8.5) | conflict-of-interest screen |
| `ip_clearance` | IP (5.x) | trademark/patent clearance |
| `litigation_hold_readiness` | Legal hold (4.3) | preservation / spoliation-risk check |
| `regulatory_applicability` | Regulatory (6.1) | does regulation X apply to activity Y |
| `privilege_review` | E-discovery (4.2) | privilege-determination checklist |

Each becomes a `run_assessment` capability + a conversational assessor via
`build_assessment_agent`.

---

## 10. Build sequence

Lead with the shipped research core + the citation/privilege controls, then the workflows.

1. **Citation-integrity pipeline + privilege/conflict walls (do this first).** The
   verify-every-cite enforcement on CourtListener (1.2), the conflicts check + ethical-wall
   setup on `quarantine`/`capability` (8.5), and the legal-act gate. Plus the legal
   assessment templates (§8). *No legal draft ships with an unverified cite; no matter opens
   with an unresolved conflict.*
2. **Extend the research pack + fast wins:** Legal Research (1.1, shipped) + KM (1.3) +
   Legal Intake (8.3) on intake/channels.
3. **Contracts (Tower 2)** on a CLM connector — Review & Redline (2.2) is the flagship.
4. **Litigation (Tower 4)** inside sealed matter compartments — Legal Hold (4.3, with the
   privacy suite) and Brief drafting (4.4, citation-gated).
5. **Cross-ref towers** (Corporate/Securities → finance+strategy; Employment/Privacy → HR+
   privacy; Regulatory/Antitrust/Trade → GRC+strategy) wired as references, not forks.
6. **IP (Tower 5)** + **Legal Ops depth** (matter/spend/legal-tech, Tower 8).
7. **Wizard + dashboard** (rule 6): jurisdiction/practice-area toggles, the Legal Operating
   Profile / playbook / conflict-wall editor, and the attorney-review console.

## 11. Honest caveats

- **Not legal advice — full stop.** Every output is research and drafting for a qualified
  attorney to review and own; the suite never practices law, and "competent supervision" is
  the human's, not the agent's. The `legal.toml` persona is the line.
- **A fabricated citation is a hard error, not a stylistic slip.** This is the failure mode
  that gets lawyers sanctioned; citation verification (§3.2) is the suite's signature
  control and gates every draft.
- **Privilege is fragile and waiver is forever.** Privileged work-product lives behind the
  ethical wall (the `quarantine` seal); any disclosure outside it can waive privilege for
  everyone — the wall is structural, not a promise.
- **Legal holds beat erasure.** When a hold is in effect, preservation overrides the
  privacy suite's retention/right-to-erasure — the two suites must reconcile, with the hold
  winning (spoliation is the worse outcome).
- **This suite is horizontal — it mostly cross-references.** Securities → finance;
  employment → HR; privacy ops → privacy; regulatory → GRC; M&A/board → strategy. The deep,
  legal-owned towers are Contracts, Litigation, and IP; the rest is the legal lens on work
  another suite performs.
- **Jurisdiction and counsel.** Law varies by jurisdiction and the hard calls are an
  attorney's; the suite scopes every answer to a jurisdiction and routes judgment to
  qualified counsel.
