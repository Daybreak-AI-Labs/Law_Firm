The Community edition is a deliberate, stripped-down on-ramp planned for after the
platform is built out; the governance / compliance control plane stays in the
commercial Enterprise edition and is never published under a permissive license.

See [`security-overview.md`](./security-overview.md) for how the Enterprise
controls are enforced.
