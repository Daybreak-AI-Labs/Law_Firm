# Single-Client Deployment — one Lightwork per enterprise

**Delivery model (decided, non-negotiable): one Lightwork instance per enterprise
client, always.** There is no shared, hosted, multi-tenant service. Cross-client
data mingling is therefore a *deployment* guarantee — separate instances,
separate hosts, separate storage — not something the application has to enforce
at request time.

On top of that physical isolation, every instance is **bound to exactly one
client** and stamps all state with that client id, so isolation is *provable*
and a misconfiguration can never silently write client data to a shared root.

This document is (1) the architecture + guarantee, (2) the remediation roadmap
to get fully enterprise-ready, and (3) the per-client deployment runbook.

---

## 1. The isolation guarantee

| Layer | How a single client is isolated |
|---|---|
| **Deployment** | One Lightwork process/host/volume per client. Two clients never share a host. |
| **Client binding** | `[client] id` / `MAVERICK_CLIENT_ID` binds the instance. `[client] enforce = true` (auto-on under enterprise mode) makes serving **fail closed** if unbound. |
| **Tenant floor** (`maverick.client` + `maverick.paths`) | The client id is the tenant *floor*: every `data_dir()` path — world DB, audit chain + keys, cross-session memory, fleet memory — resolves under `~/.maverick/tenants/<client>/…`. There is no un-scoped global location for client data. |
| **At-rest encryption** | Per-tenant DEK wrapped by a KEK, with the client id bound into the AEAD context (`tenant/kms.py`), so a key cannot decrypt another scope's data. Enable with `[encryption] at_rest = true` + `per_tenant = true`. |
| **Audit** | Signed, hash-chained, per-client audit dir + signing key; `maverick doctor` shows the bound client + data root. |

**Status (this PR): the client-binding keystone is shipped** — binding, tenant
floor, dashboard routing through the client world DB, fail-closed `serve()`
guards, a `doctor` check, config + wizard. Everything below is the roadmap to
"fully deliverable."

---

## 2. Remediation roadmap

Sequenced by leverage. Each phase is independently shippable.

### Phase 0 — Client binding & no un-scoped state ✅ (this PR)
- `[client] id` + `enforce`; client id as tenant floor; dashboard world DB
  scoped to the client; fail-closed guards on the gRPC/federation servers;
  `doctor` binding check; wizard step.

### Phase 1 — Transport encryption (TLS/mTLS) ✅
- `maverick/grpc_tls.py` builds gRPC server + channel credentials from config;
  the gRPC goal API and federation servers bind TLS via `bind_port()` and the
  federation client dials `secure_channel`. `[grpc]`/`[federation]` `tls`,
  `tls_cert`, `tls_key`, `tls_client_ca` (mTLS), and client-side `tls_ca` /
  `tls_client_cert` / `tls_client_key`.
- **Fail-closed**: when the deployment is client-bound/enterprise (or
  `tls_required = true`), a server that can't build credentials refuses to
  start and the federation client refuses to dial in the clear — sensitive data
  never silently falls back to plaintext.
- Still document TLS termination for the dashboard + MCP HTTP surfaces (reverse
  proxy or native). The federation shared token never crosses plaintext now.

### Phase 2 — Trust-plane & key administration (`maverick trust` CLI) ✅
- `maverick trust status / list / show / add / rm / revoke / unrevoke / verify`
  and `maverick trust pubkey` (print this deployment's pinned key to hand to
  peers). Write-ops manage a per-client JSON overlay (`agent_trust.json`, under
  the client's data dir) that `load_registry` merges over the hand-edited
  `[agent_trust] agents` — so peers/keys are managed without editing TOML.
- `revoke` flips `revoked` (denied immediately via `is_active`); rotation is
  `add --pubkey <new>` (overlay overrides config), with `expires_at` /
  `not_before` available for zero-downtime overlap.
- Mirror in the dashboard (read-only at minimum) — remaining follow-up.

### Phase 3 — Backup / restore / failover (HA for single-node) ✅
- `maverick backup create` snapshots the **client-scoped data root** — world DB
  (via the SQLite **online backup API**, consistent under WAL), signed **audit
  chain + anchors + keys**, memory, fleet, and the managed trust registry — into
  a portable `.tgz` with a HMAC-authenticated manifest (client id, time, schema,
  exact size and SHA-256 per file). Set a separately custodied, 32-byte
  `MAVERICK_BACKUP_SIGNING_KEY` on both the active and standby nodes; the key is
  never included in the archive. `maverick backup info` authenticates and
  inspects it; `maverick backup restore` authenticates, verifies, and applies it.
- **Fail-closed restore**: refuses an unsigned, forged, oversized, structurally
  unsafe, wrong-client, or forward-schema archive. `--force` can override only
  client/schema compatibility, never authentication. Restore uses private
  staging plus a durable transaction journal and rolls every file and SQLite
  sidecar back if publication is interrupted.
- **Warm standby**: cron `backup create`, ship the `.tgz` offsite + to a standby
  host, `backup restore` + start on failover (see runbook §3.6).

### Phase 4 — Security hardening ✅ (BYOK follow-up)
- **Mandatory shield** ✅: `maverick/shield_policy.py` — `[safety] require_shield`
  / `MAVERICK_REQUIRE_SHIELD` / enterprise mode make the shield required;
  `scan_block` fails toward the gate (a *missing* shield blocks external traffic
  when required, a scan error always blocks). Federation inbound + A2A route
  through it; `doctor` goes RED when the shield is required but absent.
- **Loopback-trust disabled** ✅ when client-bound/enterprise — the dashboard's
  no-token mode is refused; a token (or OIDC) is required.
- **Secrets hygiene** ✅: `doctor` warns when `config.toml` is group/world-
  accessible; use `${ENV}` refs for tokens (the systemd unit injects them).
- **BYOK** ✅: real cloud-KMS backends (`maverick/kms_backends.py`) behind the
  `tenant/kms.py` `KMS` Protocol — AWS KMS, GCP KMS, and Vault transit. `[kms]
  provider = aws|gcp|vault` keeps the KEK in the customer's HSM (the tenant
  context binds as the KMS EncryptionContext / AAD); a missing SDK or unknown
  provider fails closed (never downgrades to in-process keys). Env-injected
  keys (`MAVERICK_ENCRYPTION_KEY` / `MAVERICK_KMS_KEK`) remain for self-managed.

### Phase 5 — Packaging & headless provisioning (VM + image) ✅
- **Build-time gRPC stubs** ✅: `maverick gen-stubs` pre-generates every
  `*_pb2.py`; set `MAVERICK_NO_RUNTIME_PROTOC=1` in the runtime so a missing stub
  **fails fast** instead of invoking `protoc` (immutable/read-only FS; SBOM).
  Both loaders honour the guard.
- **Declarative install** ✅: `maverick init --from-file client.toml` validates
  and installs the config (0600) with no prompts — bake it into the image/VM.
- Hardened `systemd` unit + install script and baked image: see the runbook (the
  image just runs `gen-stubs` + `init --from-file` at build).

### Phase 6 — Compliance & data-subject operations ✅ (certs are organizational)
- **Per-client export + erasure** ✅: `maverick client export` (full data
  portability / DSAR — a consistent snapshot of the client's data root) and
  `maverick client erase --confirm [--keep-audit]` (right-to-erasure /
  offboarding). Because one deployment = one client = one data root, erase is
  **provably complete** (no other on-node location) and **fail-closed** (refuses
  unless a client is bound, so it can never wipe the shared root). External
  stores (a remote Postgres/Qdrant/Redis a deployment may add) are erased via
  their own admin path — documented caveat.
- Residual-plaintext (`[privacy] anonymous = true`) and `[audit] retention`
  remain config knobs as before.
- **Certification track** (organizational, not code): SOC 2 Type II, HIPAA BAA,
  third-party pen test — the control machinery (signed audit, compliance
  profiles, egress lock, erasure) is in place; the attestations are a
  process/audit-firm engagement.

## 3. Per-client deployment runbook (VM / systemd)

> One VM (or image) per client. Nothing on it is shared with another client.

### 3.1 Provision

```bash
# 1. Dedicated host, dedicated user, locked-down home.
useradd -r -m -d /var/lib/maverick maverick
install -d -o maverick -g maverick -m 0700 /var/lib/maverick/.maverick

# 2. Install (per-package wheels; pre-built, no build-time network).
python3 -m pip install --no-index --find-links /opt/maverick/wheels \
  maverick-core maverick-shield maverick-channels maverick-dashboard \
  maverick-mcp maverick-knowledge agent-shield

# 3. Pre-generate gRPC stubs (so the runtime never compiles on a read-only FS),
#    then provision config non-interactively.
maverick gen-stubs
maverick init --from-file /opt/maverick/<client>.toml
```

Set `MAVERICK_NO_RUNTIME_PROTOC=1` in the service unit so a missing stub fails
fast at boot rather than invoking `protoc` at request time.

### 3.2 Bind the client (the critical step)

`/var/lib/maverick/.maverick/config.toml`:

```toml
[client]
id = "acme-corp"          # this deployment serves ONLY acme-corp.
                          # MUST be lowercase letters/digits/._- (it is a
                          # directory name; a case-insensitive filesystem would
                          # otherwise collide "Acme" with "acme"). A non-canonical
                          # id fails closed at startup rather than serving unbound.
enforce = true            # refuse to start unbound — data can't hit the shared root

[enterprise]
mode = true               # egress lock + fail-closed consent + capabilities + (Phase 4) mandatory shield

[encryption]
at_rest = true
per_tenant = true         # DEK bound to the client id

# BYOK: keep the KEK in the customer's HSM (omit for the in-process/env key).
[kms]
provider = "aws"          # aws | gcp | vault | local
key_id   = "arn:aws:kms:us-east-1:123:key/<uuid>"   # or GCP resource name / Vault key
region   = "us-east-1"    # AWS; Vault uses address + VAULT_TOKEN

[audit]
sign = true               # tamper-evident, per-client signed chain

# Transport encryption (Phase 1). Required automatically under client binding /
# enterprise mode — the gRPC + federation servers refuse to start in plaintext.
[grpc]
tls = true
tls_cert = "/etc/maverick/tls/server.crt"
tls_key  = "/etc/maverick/tls/server.key"
tls_client_ca = "/etc/maverick/tls/clients-ca.crt"   # optional: enables mTLS

[federation]
tls = true
tls_cert = "/etc/maverick/tls/server.crt"
tls_key  = "/etc/maverick/tls/server.key"
tls_client_ca = "/etc/maverick/tls/peers-ca.crt"     # mTLS: require peer certs
tls_ca = "/etc/maverick/tls/peers-ca.crt"            # verify peers we dial
tls_client_cert = "/etc/maverick/tls/client.crt"     # our cert when dialing
tls_client_key  = "/etc/maverick/tls/client.key"
```

### 3.3 systemd unit

`/etc/systemd/system/maverick-dashboard.service`:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=Lightwork (client: acme-corp)
After=network-online.target

[Service]
User=maverick
Environment=MAVERICK_HOME=/var/lib/maverick/.maverick
Environment=MAVERICK_CLIENT_ID=acme-corp          # belt-and-suspenders: floor set in env
Environment=MAVERICK_CLIENT_ENFORCE=1
Environment=MAVERICK_DASHBOARD_TOKEN=%d/dashboard_token   # from a credential, not the file
LoadCredential=dashboard_token:/run/secrets/maverick_dashboard_token
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/maverick dashboard --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8770
# TLS terminated by the front proxy (Phase 1 adds native TLS for gRPC/federation)
Restart=on-failure
# Hardening
ProtectSystem=strict
ReadWritePaths=/var/lib/maverick/.maverick
NoNewPrivileges=true
PrivateTmp=true

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

### 3.4 Verify the binding (gate before go-live)

```bash
sudo -u maverick MAVERICK_HOME=/var/lib/maverick/.maverick \
  MAVERICK_CLIENT_ID=acme-corp maverick doctor
```

`doctor` MUST show:

```
✓ client   (bound to 'acme-corp' — data root /var/lib/maverick/.maverick/tenants/acme-corp)
```

If it shows `✗ client  (client binding ENFORCED but no client id set …)`, the
deployment will refuse to serve — fix the binding before exposing it. The whole
data tree must live under `…/tenants/acme-corp/`; nothing for this client should
appear directly under `…/.maverick/`.

### 3.6 Backup & warm-standby failover

```bash
# Provision this once through the host secret manager; use the same secret on
# the active and standby nodes. Example generation: `openssl rand -hex 32`.
export MAVERICK_BACKUP_SIGNING_KEY='<64 hex characters from secret manager>'

# Nightly consistent backup, shipped offsite + to the standby host.
sudo -u maverick MAVERICK_HOME=/var/lib/maverick/.maverick \
  MAVERICK_CLIENT_ID=acme-corp \
  MAVERICK_BACKUP_SIGNING_KEY="$MAVERICK_BACKUP_SIGNING_KEY" \
  maverick backup create --out /backups/acme.tgz
aws s3 cp /backups/acme.tgz s3://acme-maverick-dr/   # or rsync to standby

# On the STANDBY (same MAVERICK_CLIENT_ID), restore + start on failover:
maverick backup info  /backups/acme.tgz              # confirm client_id = acme-corp
maverick backup restore /backups/acme.tgz            # fail-closed if client mismatches
systemctl start maverick-dashboard
```

The restore first authenticates the manifest with the standby's
`MAVERICK_BACKUP_SIGNING_KEY`, then refuses a backup whose `client_id` differs
from the standby's binding. The CLI has no unsigned-restore bypass.

### 3.7 Offboard a client (right-to-erasure)

```bash
# Optional: hand the client their data first (portability / DSAR).
maverick client export --out /secure/acme-final-export.tgz
# Irreversible wipe of this client's entire data root (keep audit for retention):
maverick client erase --confirm --keep-audit
```

Erase refuses unless a client is bound, so it can only ever target
`tenants/<client>/` — never the shared root. Then decommission the VM/instance.

### 3.5 Cloud marketplace image

Bake the above (Phase 5): pinned wheels, pre-generated stubs, the systemd unit,
and a first-boot hook that requires `MAVERICK_CLIENT_ID` (and rejects boot
without it). One image template → one instance per client at launch.

---

## 4. Pre-go-live checklist (per client)

- [ ] `[client] id` set and `enforce = true`; `doctor` shows the bound client.
- [ ] Data tree is entirely under `tenants/<client>/`; shared root empty of client data.
- [ ] TLS on every listener (Phase 1); no plaintext gRPC/federation.
- [ ] Tokens injected from secrets (not literal in `config.toml`); config is `0600`.
- [ ] `[encryption] at_rest + per_tenant`, `[audit] sign` on; `maverick audit verify` passes.
- [ ] Backup job runs and a restore has been tested (Phase 3).
- [ ] Trust registry populated; `doctor` not RED on an empty engaged registry.
- [ ] Shield present and (Phase 4) mandatory.
