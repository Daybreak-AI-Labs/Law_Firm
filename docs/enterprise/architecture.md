# Lightwork for Enterprise — the governed agent control plane

> Status: architecture + roadmap (the blueprint for the enterprise pivot). This

## 1. The thesis

Enterprises want **fleets of agents doing real work** — every employee backed by
5–10 specialist agents — but they cannot deploy them without two things:

1. **Oversight.** A way to see, govern, and intervene in what the agents do — a
   supervisor over the swarm, not a black box.
2. **Provable compliance.** Evidence that the agents operate within the law —
   the EU AI Act *and* the US patchwork (NIST AI RMF, Colorado, NYC LL144,
   sectoral HIPAA/GLBA/FCRA), across jurisdictions, simultaneously.

Lightwork's wedge is the **control plane** that makes agent fleets *governable and
audit-ready by construction*. We already own the hardest primitives — a signed,
tamper-evident audit chain, attenuating capabilities, sandboxed execution,
human-in-the-loop consent, tenancy, and egress control. The pivot turns those
from features into the product.

The recurring failure mode in 2026 enterprise AI (per practitioner guidance):
teams implement logging, access control, and human oversight **separately for
each framework**, producing redundant controls and *gaps at the intersections*.
Lightwork's answer is a **single control plane** every agent action flows through,
with each legal regime expressed as a **pluggable policy pack** mapped onto one
set of enforceable primitives.

```

## 3. Architecture — three layers

### Layer A — Oversight control plane (the keystone / "hive mind")

A **persistent supervisor + org-policy engine** that every agent action consults
before it executes: returns **allow / deny / require-human / log**, and records
the decision to the audit chain. This is the hive-mind: one governing layer with
authority over the whole fleet, plus a human operator who can monitor and
intervene live.

- **Builds on (already shipped):** attenuating capabilities (`capability.py`),
  consent/HITL (`safety/consent.py`), signed audit (`audit/signing.py`),
  blackboard + agent-bus coordination, the recursive swarm.
- **The gap:** today governance is *per-goal and in-process*. We need to elevate
  it to a **persistent, cross-fleet control plane** — a policy engine consulted
  on every action, a supervisor role with read/intervene authority over many
  running agents, and live operator controls (approve / deny / pause / kill).

### Layer B — Compliance-regime engine (EU + US, pluggable)

The unifying insight: **don't implement controls per-law.** Define one set of
enforceable primitives and map every framework onto them. Each regime is a
**policy pack** an operator turns on per deployment; the active policy is their
union (strictest-wins).

This is also the hedge against a volatile landscape (the Dec 2025 federal
preemption EO vs. still-enforceable state laws): regimes are configuration, so a
deployment enables exactly the packs its jurisdiction + sector require.

### Layer C — Per-employee agent fleets

The unit of sale: a user **owns N persistent, named, role-scoped agents** running
ongoing and scheduled work, governed by the supervisor and bounded by their
role's capability.

- **Builds on (already shipped):** tenancy (`paths.py`), per-principal
  capabilities + RBAC roles, the scheduler/worker, `maverick ps`.
- **The gap:** a first-class `Fleet` abstraction (owner + roster + role bindings
  + policy binding), agent lifecycle (create / pause / retire), and the
  per-employee operator UX.

## 4. Compliance mapping — frameworks → primitives we already own

Each obligation below maps to a Lightwork control. **Bold** = already shipped and,
in several cases, exceeding the baseline; *italic* = the gap this roadmap closes.

| Regime | Key obligation | Lightwork control |
|---|---|---|
| **EU AI Act Art 12** (record-keeping) | append-only logs, hash-chained, ≥6-month retention | **Ed25519 *Merkle*-chained audit (`audit/signing.py`) — exceeds the SHA-256 append-only baseline**; *+ retention policy enforcement* |
| **EU AI Act Art 14** (human oversight) | monitor / intervene / override; explicit automation boundary | **consent/HITL + capability risk-ceilings**; *+ control-plane `require-human` gate + operator console* |
| **EU AI Act Art 50** (transparency, due Dec 2026) | disclose AI; mark AI-generated content | *agent-identity disclosure + output marking pack* |
| **EU AI Act risk-tiering** | classify the system's risk tier | *per-fleet/agent risk classification on the policy pack* |
| **NIST AI RMF** (US de-facto anchor) | Govern / Map / Measure / Manage | **audit + capabilities + budget/quotas + eval harness** map to all four; *+ RMF evidence report* |
| **Colorado SB 26-189 / NYC LL144 / EEOC** | consequential-decision logging, human review, bias audit | *employment/consequential-decision pack: decision records + mandatory human review + bias-audit export* |
| **HIPAA / GLBA / FCRA** (sectoral) | restrict + log sensitive-data handling | **capability path/host scopes + egress lock + tenancy**; *+ sector data-class tags* |
| **GDPR** | data residency + erasure (Art 17) | **egress lock to EU/local providers + DSAR erasure (`audit/erase.py`) + tenancy** |

**Honest read on timing.** EU high-risk (Annex III) duties were deferred to **Dec
2027** by the May 2026 Digital Omnibus, but **transparency (Dec 2026)** and
**GPAI rules (live since Aug 2025)** bite sooner — and US state laws are
enforceable now. The control plane should ship before the obligations land so
customers adopt ahead of the deadline, not under it.

## 5. What we already own (the moat)

- **Signed, tamper-evident audit** (Ed25519 Merkle chain + offline verify) —
  stronger than the Art 12 standard, and the evidentiary backbone for *every*
  regime.
- **Attenuating capabilities** — least privilege that can only narrow as it
  propagates to sub-agents; the access-control primitive every framework wants.
- **Consent / HITL** — the Art 14 intervention substrate.
- **Seven execution sandboxes, egress lock, tenancy, quotas, OIDC/proxy SSO,
  RBAC, SIEM export** — the enterprise-ops surface.
- **The recursive swarm** — the multi-agent substrate the fleet and supervisor
- **Roster-wide governance invariant suite** — six governance invariants
  (tool-reachability, autonomy dial, capability attenuation, compartment
  isolation, unstrippable hard refusals, budget caps) verified across ALL 2,020
  specialist packs, each with a
  fault-injection control (property-fuzzed up to 5,000 iterations) proving the test is non-vacuous, plus hostile-argument
  fuzzing of every connector and tool. This is the machine-checkable evidence
  under the Art 14 oversight / NIST *Measure* obligations: the controls aren't
  asserted, they're proven to hold fleet-wide.
- **Primary-source data grounding** — analyst packs are auto-granted 37
  read-only, GET-only public-data connectors (SEC EDGAR, FRED, Treasury, World
  Bank, FDIC, Census, BLS, EIA, openFDA, NPPES, CourtListener, Federal Register,
  GLEIF, OpenCorporates, NWS/NOAA, EPA, …) by suite, so consequential analysis is
  grounded in authoritative sources rather than model memory. On by default;
  kill-switch `[workforce] data_grounding = false` / `MAVERICK_WORKFORCE_DATA_GROUNDING=off`.
  are built from.

The pivot is not a rebuild; it is **promoting these from per-run features to a
persistent, multi-tenant control plane**, plus the regime packs and the fleet
model on top.

## 6. Build sequence

1. **Keystone — oversight control plane.** A `governance` policy engine:
   org policy → per-action decision (`allow` / `deny` / `require_human` / `log`),
   consulted by the agent on every tool call, recording each decision to the
   audit chain. A supervisor read/intervene API. Offline-unit-testable on the
   decision logic. *(This PR's successor.)*
2. **Compliance-regime packs.** A `ComplianceRegime` abstraction + the first
   packs (EU AI Act, NIST AI RMF) as policy + evidence mappings; a
   `maverick compliance status --regime <id>` posture report (generalizes the
   existing `soc2` command).
3. **Fleet model.** A `Fleet` / roster abstraction + lifecycle + supervisor
   binding + the per-employee unit.
4. **Operator console.** A dashboard view of the fleet with **live human
   oversight** — approve / deny / pause / kill — the Art 14 UI surface.

## 7. Honest caveats

- **"Compliant" = "provides the technical controls and evidence that compliance
  requires" — not legal certification.** The mapping of *your* obligations to
  *your* risk tier needs counsel; Lightwork supplies the enforceable controls and
  the audit evidence, and makes the posture auditable.
- **The US federal picture is volatile.** The pluggable-pack design is the hedge:
  enable the regimes a deployment is actually subject to; the strictest-wins
  union keeps multi-jurisdiction deployments safe by default.
