# Lightwork cookbook

End-to-end recipes you can paste into `maverick start "..."` (or into a
GitHub issue body when using the `agent-on-pr` reusable workflow).

Each recipe is:

- **Self-contained**: doesn't assume you have anything beyond a fresh
  Lightwork install (native installer or source today; `pip install
  maverick-agent` once published) + `maverick init`.
- **Bounded**: ~3 minutes of agent runtime on Claude Sonnet 4.6,
  budget-capped at $1.
- **Real**: copy-paste-and-run, no placeholder TODOs in the goal text.

## Submitting your own

PRs welcome. Criteria:

1. Self-contained: works against any reasonable repo, no
   user-specific setup.
2. Budget-bounded: < $1 on Sonnet 4.6 budget caps.
3. Documented expected output (what success looks like, what failure
   modes are common).
4. Tested at least once by the contributor against a real repo.
