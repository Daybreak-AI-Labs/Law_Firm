# Getting started

## Install

The Maverick distribution names are not yet reserved on public PyPI, so do
not install those names from the public index. Install a reviewed source
commit instead:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Daybreak-AI-Labs/Law_Firm
cd Maverick
git checkout --detach <reviewed-full-40-character-commit-sha>
pip install -e ./packages/maverick-core
pip install -e ./apps/installer-cli
maverick init
```

If you need the no-prerequisite desktop bootstrap, download
`deploy/desktop/install.sh` or `deploy/desktop/install.ps1` from the same
commit, verify it, and set `MAVERICK_REF` to the lowercase, full SHA. The
scripts fail on missing or mutable refs and have no public-index fallback.
Every `MAVERICK_*` variable can also be spelled `MAVERICK_*`.

From source while iterating:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Daybreak-AI-Labs/Law_Firm
cd Maverick
pip install -e ./packages/maverick-core
pip install -e ./apps/installer-cli
maverick init
```

## First run

```bash
maverick init
maverick preflight
maverick doctor
```

The wizard takes ~2 minutes. It writes `~/.maverick/config.toml` and `~/.maverick/.env`.

Then:

```bash
maverick start "Build a CLI that emails me a digest of today's top Hacker News stories — research the API, write it, and verify it runs"
```

## Watch the swarm decompose

Run `maverick monitor` in a second terminal. The orchestrator plans the goal, then spawns specialist sub-agents that work in parallel — here a researcher pins down the API, a coder writes the tool, and a verifier runs it:

```
Goal #1 active  2m elapsed
Build a CLI that emails me a digest of today's top Hacker News stories

Plan tree
  ├─        done  #2 Research the Hacker News Firebase API
  ├─      active  #3 Write the digest CLI (fetch + format + send)
  ├─      active  #4 Verify it runs and emails a sample digest
  ├─     pending  #5 Write a short usage README

Latest episode #7 (running)  $0.0431  in=18,204 out=2,910 tools=11

Recent activity

  3s ago [coder] tool_call: write_file hn_digest.py (118 lines)
  1s ago [verifier] tool_call: run "python hn_digest.py --dry-run" -> printed 10 stories

Cumulative spend on this DB: $0.21
```

When done:

```bash
maverick status      # what's currently active or blocked
maverick skills      # what the swarm distilled from this run
maverick facts       # what it learned about you
```

## Pausing / resuming

If the swarm needs something only you can answer, it pauses and queues a question:

```bash
maverick status
# shows: open questions: #3 (goal 1): Which dates are you traveling?

maverick answer 3 "May 15-29"
maverick resume
```

Goals survive restarts. You can shut your laptop and come back tomorrow.

## Building your own specialist from a watched task

You don't have to describe a job in words — you can show it. Capture an ordered
record of someone doing the work (the actions they took and any narration of why)
as JSONL or simple prefixed text, then hand the file to Maverick:

```
ACTION[gmail]: send the morning digest -> ops@acme.com
NOTE: only the top 5 stories, with one-line summaries
SEE: digest looks right, ops confirmed receipt
```

```bash
maverick learn-demo demo.txt
```

This parses the demonstration, induces a draft specialist, shows you the derived
workflow, and waits for your approval before saving. Secrets are redacted at the
door, and the draft inherits the same capability clamp and persona scan a
described pack gets — nothing activates without your yes. Useful flags:

```bash
maverick learn-demo demo.txt --name "Morning Digest" --no-llm --yes
```

`--no-llm` mirrors the observed steps deterministically (tools = what the person
used); drop it to let the model propose from the transcript.

The same agent-factory flow runs when you build a pack conversationally:

```bash
maverick onboard
```

On approval, `onboard` now provisions the pack — it installs the catalog skills
its workflow needs and synthesizes any declared tools that aren't built in, so a
freshly approved specialist is equipped to do its job from the first run. (This
step honors the `[self_learning]` / `provision_packs` config and never widens the
pack's clamped envelope.)

## Voice input (built-in, offline)

The dashboard's mic button and the `transcribe_audio` tool work with no
provider key: the local Whisper engine ships with the dashboard package, and
the checksum-verified model is fetched automatically when the dashboard
first starts (skipped on egress-locked deployments, or with
`[voice] auto_fetch_model = false`). The CLI covers the details:

```bash
maverick voice setup    # fetch the checksum-verified model (~148 MB)
maverick voice status   # see which speech-to-text backends are usable
maverick voice transcribe clip.wav   # smoke-test the pipeline
```

Prefer a system engine instead? A `whisper.cpp` binary on PATH (`brew
install whisper-cpp`) or faster-whisper both plug into the same chain. Set
`[voice] stt_backend = "local"` to keep audio on-machine even when
OpenAI/Groq keys are configured.

## Changing models or providers

Re-run the wizard any time:

```bash
maverick init
```

Or edit `~/.maverick/config.toml` directly. The `[models]` section maps each agent role to a `provider:model-id` string. See [`configuration.md`](./configuration.md) for the schema.

## Where data lives

| File | What |
|---|---|
| `~/.maverick/config.toml` | Your config (deployment, models, safety, budget) |
| `~/.maverick/.env` | API keys (chmod 600) |
| `~/.maverick/world.db` | Persistent world model: goals, facts, episodes |
| `~/.maverick/skills/` | Auto-distilled SKILL.md files from successful runs |
| `~/maverick-workspace/` | Default sandbox working directory |
| `~/.maverick/learned-skills/` | Skills distilled by the learning loops |
| `~/.maverick/dreams/` | Consolidated insights, rehearsal queue, learning snapshots |

All local. Nothing is uploaded except your prompts to the cloud LLM you chose.

Once you have a few runs behind you, the learning surface is four commands:
`maverick dream` (consolidate experience), `maverick hindsight` (did learning
help or regress?), `maverick proof` (deliverables, cost avoided, ROI), and
`maverick domains-lint` (audit the 2,020-agent specialist catalog), plus
`maverick domains-audit` (governance posture: what each agent can reach, denies,
and refuses) and `maverick domains-eval --check` (behavioral golden cases).
