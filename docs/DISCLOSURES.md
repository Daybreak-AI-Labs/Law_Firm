# Coordinated security disclosures

Resolved security issues, published after the embargo window in
[`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md) (90 days, or sooner once a fix ships and users
have had a reasonable window to upgrade). This is the public record the roadmap's
"coordinated-disclosure log" item calls for — a standing companion to
`SECURITY.md` (which covers *how* to report) and `CHANGELOG.md` (which lists *what*
changed).

To report a vulnerability, see [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md). Do not open a
public issue for an unpatched vulnerability.

## How to read this log

Each row is one resolved, disclosed issue:

- **ID** — `MAV-YYYY-NNN` (assigned on triage) and/or the CVE if one was issued.
- **Severity** — CVSS-style qualitative tier (low / medium / high / critical).
- **Affected** — package(s) + version range.
- **Fixed in** — the first release containing the fix.
- **Reported** / **Fixed** / **Disclosed** — dates (UTC).
- **Credit** — reporter, if they wish to be named.
