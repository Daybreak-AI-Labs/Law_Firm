# Control Crosswalk: SOC 2 ↔ ISO 27001 ↔ ISO 42001

This is the master mapping for Lightwork's compliance program. Each row is a
control theme mapped across the three frameworks, to the concrete Lightwork
control(s) that satisfy it, and to the codebase evidence. It lets one body of
work serve all three audits and lets an auditor cross-reference frameworks.

**Status legend** (same as [`soc2-controls.md`](soc2-controls.md)):

| Status | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| **Implemented** | A concrete, enforced technical control exists in code. |
| **Implemented (opt-in)** | Exists and enforced, but off-by-default — must be enabled for a compliant deployment. |
| **Partial** | A control exists but is scoped or incomplete. |
| **Process** | Satisfied by an organizational process outside the repo (company-owned). |
| **Gap** | No control today; to be built or established. |

Framework references: SOC 2 = AICPA Trust Services Criteria (2017, rev. 2022).
ISO 27001 = ISO/IEC 27001:2022 Annex A (93 controls, themes A.5 Organizational /
A.6 People / A.7 Physical / A.8 Technological). ISO 42001 = ISO/IEC 42001:2023
Annex A (AI controls A.2–A.10).

## Cross-framework gap summary

The work that remains is concentrated, not scattered:

**Process gaps (shared across SOC 2 / ISO 27001 / ISO 42001):**
change-management process · vendor/sub-processor management · incident-response
program · HR security · documented risk-assessment program · vulnerability
management & pen-test cadence · physical security (cloud-inherited).

**Engineering gaps (enable, don't build):** flip on the opt-in controls —
capabilities, tenant isolation, quotas, OIDC, encryption at rest, audit signing
— for any compliant deployment. See [`soc2/README.md`](soc2/README.md).

**ISO 42001-specific build gaps:** *all closed.* (1) operator-declared model-card
metadata export, (2) governed AI-system retirement with a signed audit record
(incl. concrete subject-scoped `erase`), and (3) continuous rolling-window
fairness monitoring with four-fifths/drift alerts are now implemented
(`maverick/model_cards.py`, `maverick/retirement.py`, `maverick/fairness_monitor.py`).
See [`iso-42001/README.md`](iso-42001/README.md).
