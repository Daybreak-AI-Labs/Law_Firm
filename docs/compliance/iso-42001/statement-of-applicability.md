# Statement of Applicability (SoA) — ISO/IEC 42001:2023

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Document ID | AIMS-SOA-01 |
| Owner | Christopher Day |
| Approver | Christopher Day |
| Version | 1.0 |
| Status | Approved — effective 2026-06-24 (Christopher Day) |
| Standard | ISO/IEC 42001:2023, Annex A (controls A.2–A.10) |

This SoA records, for each ISO 42001 Annex A control: **Applicability**,
**justification**, **implementation status**, and **evidence**. Determinations
are driven by the [risk register](../risk-register.md) (AI risks R-19…R-25) and
[methodology](../risk-management-methodology.md) (incl. AI impact assessment).

**Status:** Implemented · Partial · Process · Gap. **Applicable:** Y / N.

> Summary: all controls **Applicable**, none excluded. Strengths concentrate in
> A.6 (lifecycle), A.7 (data), and A.9 (human oversight). The former build gaps —
> model-card metadata export, AI-system retirement, and continuous fairness
> monitoring — are now **Implemented**.

## Exclusions

**None.** All ISO 42001:2023 Annex A controls are determined Applicable. The
former **Gap** items — A.6.2.7 model-card metadata export (R-25), AI-system
retirement (R-24), and continuous fairness monitoring at A.6.2.6 (R-22) — are now
all **Implemented** (`model_cards.py`, `retirement.py`, `fairness_monitor.py`).
The remaining ISO 42001 work is management-system documentation and the shared
organizational (Process) controls, not code.
