The inventory of information assets within the ISMS/AIMS scope (ISO 27001 A.5.9),
each with an owner, a classification (A.5.12), and the controls that protect it.
This is the asset register the [risk methodology](../risk-management-methodology.md)
and [Statement of Applicability](../iso-27001/statement-of-applicability.md) refer
to. Classification scale: **Restricted** > **Confidential** > **Internal** > **Public**.

## Notes

- **Owners** are role placeholders — assign named individuals at management review.
- Physical/infrastructure assets (servers, storage media) are **inherited from the
  cloud provider** (ISO 27001 A.7) and evidenced via their certification, not
  inventoried here.
- Each Restricted/Confidential asset maps to one or more risks in the
  [risk register](../risk-register.md); review this inventory and the register
  together each cycle.
