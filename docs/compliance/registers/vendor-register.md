## How to use this register

This register is the Organization's authoritative inventory of in-scope vendors
and suppliers, maintained under the Vendor & Supplier Management Procedure
(PROC-07). It is operated by the Organization — **[Org action]** — and reviewed
at least annually and on material change.

- **One row per vendor** that processes Organization/customer data or feeds the
  Lightwork software supply chain (see PROC-07 §1 for scope).
- **Add a vendor** at onboarding Step 5 (PROC-07 §2) once risk-tiered, reviewed
  (TPL-04), and contracted. Vendors that process **customer data** must **also**
  appear in `docs/compliance/registers/subprocessor-register.md` and the
  customer-facing `docs/enterprise/legal/subprocessors.md`.
- **Risk tier** (Critical / High / Medium / Low) is assigned per PROC-07 §3 and
  drives the diligence required and the re-review cadence (Critical/High:
  annual; Medium: 18–24 months; Low: 24 months).
- **Keep `next review due` current.** A row past its review date, or a vendor
  whose SOC 2 / ISO assurance has lapsed, is overdue and must be re-assessed.
- **On offboarding**, set **Status** to *Offboarded* (do not delete the row —
  retain it as audit evidence) and remove the vendor from the subprocessor
  register and customer-facing disclosure per PROC-07 §7.
