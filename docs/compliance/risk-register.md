# Risk Register

| Owner | Christopher Day |
| Approver | Christopher Day |
| Version | 1.0 |
| Status | Approved — effective 2026-06-24 (Christopher Day) |
| Review cycle | Quarterly, and on significant change |
| Methodology | [`risk-management-methodology.md`](risk-management-methodology.md) |

This is the consolidated register of information-security and AI risks. It is
seeded from the STRIDE threat model (`docs/security/threat-model.md`), the
pen-test readiness scope (`docs/security/audit-readiness.md`), and the SOC 2
control gaps ([`soc2-controls.md`](soc2-controls.md)). Scores follow the
[methodology](risk-management-methodology.md): Likelihood × Impact, 1–25.

`I` = inherent (pre-control), `R` = residual (post-control). Controls are
cross-referenced to the [crosswalk](control-crosswalk.md) and SoA.

| R-12 | **Availability loss / unrecoverable run** | 3×3=9 | Mitigate: durable checkpoint/resume, job queue, circuit breakers. **Process**: DR site, RTO/RPO | 2×3=6 | Christopher Day | Treat — process gap open |

## Process / organizational risks (shared compliance gaps)

| ID | Risk | L×I (I) | Treatment | L×I (R) | Owner | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| R-13 | **No formal change-management process** (approvals, SoD, prod sign-off) | 3×4=12 | Establish process per POL-05; CI gates already enforce technical control | 2×3=6 | Christopher Day | **Open — Process** |
| R-14 | **No vendor/sub-processor management program** (LLM providers, infra) | 4×4=16 | Establish reviews + DPAs + maintained inventory per POL-09 | 2×3=6 | Christopher Day | **Open — Process** |
| R-15 | **No operational incident-response program** (on-call, escalation, breach SLAs) | 3×4=12 | Establish IR runbooks + on-call per POL-07; containment primitives exist | 2×3=6 | Christopher Day | **Open — Process** |

| R-17 | **No documented, periodic risk-assessment program with management review** | 3×4=12 | This methodology + register + quarterly review closes it | 2×2=4 | Christopher Day | **In progress** |
| R-18 | **No scheduled vulnerability scanning / penetration testing cadence** | 4×4=16 | Establish quarterly scan + annual third-party pen test with remediation tracking | 2×3=6 | Christopher Day | **Open — Process** |

| R-25 | **No formal model-card metadata** (intended use, limits, eval results) | 2×3=6 | Mitigate: operator-declared metadata merged into model cards + export (`model_cards.py`) | 1×3=3 | Christopher Day | **Closed** |

## Heat summary (residual)

| Band | Count | IDs |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Critical (16–25) | 0 | — |
| High (10–15) | 1 | R-01 |
| Medium (5–9) | 15 | R-02–R-08, R-10, R-12–R-21 (subset) |
| Low (1–4) | 6 | R-09, R-11, R-16, R-17, R-23 (subset) |
| Closed | 3 | R-22, R-24, R-25 (controls now implemented) |

> R-01 (sandbox escape) remains the single High residual risk and is the
> headline target for the planned third-party penetration test. All Critical
> inherent risks are reduced to High or Medium by existing controls **once the
> opt-in security controls are enabled** — see [`soc2/README.md`](soc2/README.md).
