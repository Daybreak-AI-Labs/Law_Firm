| Owner | Christopher Day |
| Approver | Christopher Day |
| Version | 1.0 |
| Status | Approved — effective 2026-06-24 (Christopher Day) |
| Standard | ISO/IEC 27001:2022, Annex A (93 controls) |

The SoA is a **mandatory** ISO 27001 document (Clause 6.1.3 d). It records, for
every Annex A control: whether it is **Applicable**, the **justification**, the
**implementation status**, and the **evidence**. Inclusion/exclusion is driven
by the [risk assessment](../risk-register.md) and
[methodology](../risk-management-methodology.md).

**Status:** Implemented · Implemented (opt-in) · Partial · Process · Gap (see the
[crosswalk](../control-crosswalk.md) legend). **Applicable:** Y / N.

> Summary: of 93 controls, **all are Applicable**. Physical controls (A.7) are
> applicable but **inherited** from the cloud hosting provider and evidenced via
> the provider's own certification. No controls are excluded.

## Exclusions

**None.** All 93 Annex A:2022 controls are determined Applicable. Physical
controls (A.7) are satisfied through inheritance from the cloud hosting provider
and will be evidenced via the provider's current SOC 2 Type II / ISO 27001
certification at audit time.
