## Scoring & decision

Reviewer scores each applicable section **0–4**; weight Critical/High vendors
toward Sections B, C, D, E, G, J (and K for AI vendors).

| Score | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| 4 | Fully meets requirements with independent evidence |
| 3 | Meets requirements; minor gap, no material risk |
| 2 | Partial; remediation or compensating control needed |
| 1 | Significant gap; risk acceptance required to proceed |
| 0 | Does not meet a mandatory requirement; **do not onboard** without remediation |

| Section | Score (0–4) | Notes / evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| A — Company & contact | | |
| B — Certifications & assurance | | |
| C — Data handling & residency | | |
| D — Encryption | | |
| E — Access control & auth | | |
| F — Sub-processors | | |
| G — Incident & breach | | |
| H — BC/DR | | |
| I — Vuln mgmt & testing | | |
| J — Privacy / GDPR / DPA | | |
| K — AI / model governance (if AI vendor) | | |

**Mandatory gate (Critical/High):** a current SOC 2 Type II **or** ISO/IEC 27001
report **and** a signed DPA (where personal data is processed). A `0` on any
mandatory item blocks onboarding absent a documented risk acceptance.

**Overall risk rating:** `<Low / Medium / High / Critical>`
