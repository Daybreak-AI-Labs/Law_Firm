# SOC 2 Controls Mapping

This document maps the SOC 2 **Trust Services Criteria (TSC)** to the concrete
Lightwork controls that satisfy each. It is the foundation of the SOC 2
workstream: a controls inventory an auditor can read alongside the
machine-readable evidence collector in
[`packages/maverick-core/maverick/soc2.py`](https://github.com/Daybreak-AI-Labs/Lightwork/blob/main/packages/maverick-core/maverick/soc2.py)
(`collect_soc2_evidence()`).

> **Honesty note.** SOC 2 is an *organizational* attestation, not a code audit.
> Lightwork's engineering controls cover a large share of the **Security (Common
> Criteria)** plus the **Confidentiality / Availability / Processing Integrity /
> Privacy** categories — but a real SOC 2 Type II report also requires
> *process* controls (change management, vendor management, background checks,
> incident response, HR onboarding/offboarding) that are **not code**. Those are
> marked **Process-only** or **Gap** below and must be owned by the company, not
> the repo.

## Status legend

| Status | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| **Implemented** | A concrete, enforced technical control exists in the codebase. |
| **Partial** | A control exists but is opt-in/off-by-default, scoped, or incomplete. |
| **Gap** | No control today; needs to be built or established. |
| **Process-only** | Satisfied (if at all) by an organizational process outside this repo, not by code. |

The "Evidence" column points at a module/file, or — where the
[`soc2.py`](https://github.com/Daybreak-AI-Labs/Lightwork/blob/main/packages/maverick-core/maverick/soc2.py) collector reports it
live — the **evidence key** (the dotted path into `collect_soc2_evidence()`'s
output, e.g. `controls.capability_enforcement`).

## Process-only / Gap summary (NOT code)

A SOC 2 Type II report cannot pass on engineering controls alone. The following
are explicitly **out of scope for this repo** and must be owned as company
processes (or built where marked Gap):

- **Change management policy** (CC8): documented approvals, segregation of
  duties, prod-deploy sign-off. (Code controls: CI gates + PR review.)
- **Vendor / sub-processor management** (CC9.2): security reviews, DPAs,
  sub-processor inventory for LLM providers and infra.
- **Incident response program** (CC7.4): runbooks, on-call, escalation, customer
  notification SLAs. (Code controls: killswitch + circuit breakers.)
- **HR controls** (CC1): background checks, onboarding/offboarding, security
  training, acceptable-use & confidentiality agreements.
- **Physical & environmental security** (CC6/A1): data-center/hosting controls —
  inherited from the cloud provider; document via their SOC 2.
- **Risk assessment program** (CC3): periodic, documented enterprise risk
  assessment with management review.
- **Vulnerability management / pen testing cadence** (CC7.1): scheduled scans
  and third-party penetration tests with remediation tracking.

### Engineering Gaps to close

- **Several controls are opt-in / off-by-default** (capabilities, tenant
  isolation, quotas, OIDC, encryption at rest, and audit signing). For a SOC 2
  deployment these must be turned **on** and shown enabled (`audit_log` = `ok`,
  not `unsigned`) in the evidence snapshot — see "Verifying posture" below. The
  opt-in default is intentional (single-tenant local use is unchanged), but a
  compliant deployment must flip them on.

## The evidence collector

[`maverick/soc2.py`](https://github.com/Daybreak-AI-Labs/Lightwork/blob/main/packages/maverick-core/maverick/soc2.py) exposes:

```python
from maverick.soc2 import collect_soc2_evidence
snapshot = collect_soc2_evidence()
```

It returns a JSON-serializable posture snapshot. Top-level keys:

| Key | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `version` | maverick package version |
| `collected_at` | UTC epoch seconds of collection |
| `controls.capability_enforcement` | capability enforcement on/off (CC6.1/CC6.3) |
| `controls.tenant_isolation` | per-user tenant isolation on/off (C1.1) |
| `controls.usage_quotas` | per-principal usage quotas on/off (CC9.1/A1.1) |
| `controls.oidc_auth` | OIDC ID-token verifier on/off (CC6.1) |
| `controls.encryption_at_rest` | AES-256-GCM at-rest encryption on/off (CC6.7/C1.1) |
| `controls.data_subject_export` | DSAR access/portability export present (P5; presence probe → `enabled`/`absent`) |
| `audit_log` | audit-chain plus anchor-ledger verification: `ok` / `broken` (tamper) / `unsigned` (signing off) / `empty` / `no_crypto` / `unknown` (CC2.1/PI1.5) |
| `audit_signing_key` | audit signing-key presence (tamper-evidence trust anchor) |

Each `controls.*` probe carries a `status` of `enabled` / `disabled` / `absent`
/ `unknown`. The collector is **fail-soft**: a missing optional module is
`absent`, a probe that raises is `unknown`, and the call never throws.
(`controls.data_subject_export` is a *presence* probe — it reports `enabled`
when the capability is shipped or `absent` when it is not, and never `disabled`
or `unknown`, since it checks only that the code exists rather than calling it.)

### Verifying posture

```bash
python -c "import json; from maverick.soc2 import collect_soc2_evidence; \
print(json.dumps(collect_soc2_evidence(), indent=2))"
```

A SOC 2-ready deployment should show `capability_enforcement`,
`tenant_isolation`, `usage_quotas`, and `oidc_auth` as `enabled`,
`encryption_at_rest` as `enabled`, and `audit_log` as `ok` with
`audit_signing_key` present.

At-rest encryption and audit signing **default ON** (secure-by-default —
`maverick.security_defaults.secure_by_default`), unless explicitly disabled
(`MAVERICK_SECURE_DEFAULT=0`, or the per-control knobs `[encryption] at_rest` /
`[audit] sign`). So on a fresh install `encryption_at_rest` reports `enabled`, and
once the audit log has rows they are signed and the per-day chains plus cross-file
anchor ledger verify `ok` (the log reads `empty` only until the first write, and
`audit_signing_key` becomes present once the first signed row is written). With
signing explicitly off the log is reported `unsigned` — append-only, but not
cryptographically tamper-evident.

The deployment-specific controls that would break the zero-config happy path stay
opt-in and must be turned on for a full SOC 2 posture: `capability_enforcement`,
`tenant_isolation`, `usage_quotas`, and `oidc_auth` (OIDC would otherwise lock out
the local single-user dashboard).

> **Follow-on (not in this change):** a `maverick soc2` CLI command that prints
> this snapshot (and exits non-zero if required controls are not `enabled`) is a
> deliberate next step. It belongs in `cli.py` and the installer wizard, which
> this workstream intentionally does not touch.
