Boilerplate, key facts, and naming rules for writing about Lightwork. Counts
and capability claims on this page are grounded in the
[platform overview](./index.md) and linked product documentation.

## Boilerplate

Lightwork is a proprietary, commercially licensed agent runtime for enterprises
and regulated teams that need AI agents they can govern, audit, and run
entirely in their own environment. Hand it a goal and its orchestrator
decomposes the work and spawns specialist sub-agents — researcher, coder,
writer, verifier — that work in parallel under hard dollar, wall-clock, and
tool-call caps, with every input, tool call, and output screened by the Agent
Shield safety layer and every action recorded in a signed, append-only audit
log. The runtime is self-hosted — laptop, Docker, VPS, Kubernetes, or
air-gapped — and model-agnostic: 12 LLM providers, routable per role, so
customers pick the models. It ships 286 built-in tool modules, 17
messaging/voice/wearable channels, and 9 sandbox backends, and can be driven
from other languages over MCP and gRPC. Lightwork is developed by Day AI Labs.

### 50-word version

Lightwork is a proprietary, commercially licensed, self-hosted AI agent runtime
for enterprises. A recursive orchestrator decomposes goals and spawns
specialist sub-agents that work in parallel under hard budget caps, behind a
safety shield, with a signed audit log. It ships 2,020 prebuilt specialist
agents across 53 business suites (every pack lint-audited for least-privilege
envelopes), a closed learning lifecycle — agents consolidate experience,
provably improve, and every learned change is audited and reversible — plus
286 built-in tool modules, 514 reusable skills, 17 channels, 9 sandbox backends, and 12 LLM providers.

### 25-word version

Lightwork is a proprietary, self-hosted multi-agent runtime for enterprises: a
recursive swarm under hard budget caps, a safety shield, and a signed,
append-only audit log.

## Key facts

- **License model**: proprietary, commercially licensed. Use, redistribution,
  and derivative works require a license (see
  [`LICENSE`](https://github.com/Daybreak-AI-Labs/Lightwork/blob/main/LICENSE)). A
  stripped-down open-source "lite" edition is a stated possibility in product
  planning, not a commitment.
- **Deployment**: self-hosted — laptop, Docker, VPS, Kubernetes, or a
  disconnected/air-gapped network with no required data egress.
- **Implementation**: Python (3.10–3.12), 2000+ tests in CI; other languages
  drive the runtime over MCP and gRPC rather than re-implementing it.
- **Architecture**: recursive multi-agent swarm — an orchestrator spawns
  parallel specialist sub-agents, with a default-on verifier, reflexion
  retries, and a graded critic.
- **Safety**: the Agent Shield layer screens at three chokepoints (input,
  tool call, output); hard budget caps and a killswitch bound every run.
- **Surface area** (counts from `FEATURES.md`): 286 built-in tool modules and
  514 reusable skills; 2,877 write-capable enterprise REST/GraphQL connectors
  plus 37 read-only primary-source / public-data connectors (SEC EDGAR, FRED,
  Treasury, World Bank, FDIC, Census, BLS, EIA, openFDA, NPPES,
  ClinicalTrials, USAspending, SAM.gov, CourtListener, Federal Register,
  GLEIF, OpenCorporates, NWS/NOAA, EPA, ...) and dedicated-module connectors
  (Salesforce, HubSpot, Stripe, ServiceNow, Snowflake, ...); 17 wired
  channels; 9 sandbox backends; 12 LLM providers, routable per role.
- **Auditability**: signed, append-only audit log (`maverick audit verify`),
  SIEM export, encryption-at-rest, DSAR, data-retention enforcement.
- **Distribution**: installable from reviewed source today. A successful tagged
  release is configured to publish Sigstore-verifiable PyInstaller binaries, a
  GHCR image, reduced licensed source archives, checksums, and SBOMs. The Tauri
  and MSI trees are engineering source-bootstrap/build artifacts; a
  self-contained, platform-signed native installer is not currently shipped.
  Public PyPI consumption remains disabled until every first-party project name
  is reserved and protected.
- **Status**: alpha; verify the exact assets present on a release rather than
  treating a tag or build recipe as a downloadable product.
- **Maker**: Day AI Labs (Christopher Day).

## Naming and trademark usage

"Lightwork", the Lightwork name, and the Lightwork logo are trademarks of
Christopher Day / Day AI Labs and are **not** licensed under the software
[`LICENSE`](https://github.com/Daybreak-AI-Labs/Lightwork/blob/main/LICENSE).
The full
[`TRADEMARK.md`](https://github.com/Daybreak-AI-Labs/Lightwork/blob/main/TRADEMARK.md)
policy applies; the short version for writers:

- **Product name**: "Lightwork", capital M. The CLI command is lowercase
  `maverick`; the PyPI distribution is `maverick-agent`.
- **Permitted without asking**: nominative, factual references — naming
  Lightwork in an article, review, or comparison, or saying something is
  "compatible with Lightwork" — where no endorsement or affiliation is implied.
- **Not permitted without written permission**: using the marks (or
  confusingly similar names/logos) for your own product, service, fork, or
  distribution; in domain names, package names, company names, or advertising;
  or describing any build as the "official" Lightwork.
