## The problem

The self-improvement controller (`maverick.self_improvement`) promotes a change
when its evidence beats baseline:

```python
improvement = cand.candidate_score - cand.baseline_score   # the evidence gate
```

Those scores were **correlational aggregates** — a synthesized tool's raw
success rate (`ToolOutcomeTracker`), a before/after eval mean. In a system that
rewrites **itself**, correlational credit is a *superstition pump*: a change that
merely co-occurs with success — because it was tried on easier sub-goals, or ran
alongside the decision that actually mattered — gets promoted, reinforced, and
compounded. The audit log faithfully signs each ritual as "beat baseline."

The fix is not a new gate. It's changing **what the evidence number means**: a
*causal* effect, not a correlation.

## Phase A — confounder-adjusted effect estimation (shipped)

`maverick.promotion_effect` estimates the effect of a candidate change on task
outcome from the logged trajectory population, adjusting for confounders by
**stratification** (subclassification): within each cell of comparable context
(domain, depth bucket, …) compare treated vs untreated outcomes, then average the
per-cell effects weighted by cell size. Cells with no overlap (only treated, or
only untreated) carry no causal information and are dropped; the comparable
fraction (`overlap`) is reported, never hidden.

Output (`EffectEstimate`): the effect, a 95% CI, `n_used`/`n_total`, `overlap`,
the **naive** (confounded) difference for contrast, a **placebo** effect, and a
`trustworthy` flag.

**Wiring into the ladder (unchanged safety spine):**

- `Candidate.effect_ci_low` — when set, the evidence gate requires the **lower
  confidence bound** of the causal effect to clear the margin (promote only when
  confident the change *caused* the win). Every other gate (capability
  non-escalation, human approval, reversibility, calibration freeze) is
  untouched.
- `si_producers.propose_with_effect(...)` — builds the candidate from an
  `EffectEstimate`, stamps provenance `{effect, ci, naive, adjusted_for, n,
  overlap, placebo}` into the signed `LEARNING_UPDATE`, and **fails closed** on
  an untrustworthy estimate.
- `trajectory_store.TrajectoryStep` gained `parent_step` (decision-DAG edge) and
  `outcome` (terminal task label) so episodes reduce to causal units via
  `promotion_effect.units_from_trajectories`.

**Fail-safe by calibration.** `trustworthy` is False when overlap is too low, or
when a **placebo** — treatment labels permuted *within* strata, which must yield
~0 — leaks a non-zero effect (the estimate is then an artifact, not an effect).
This mirrors the existing "freeze learning when the verifier is mis-calibrated"
interlock, applied to the credit estimator.

**Posture.** OFF by default (`[self_improvement] causal_promotion` /
`MAVERICK_CAUSAL_PROMOTION`). The estimator is a pure, dependency-free function;
nothing changes in a default deployment.

**Distinct from CSCA** (`maverick.credit`): that is *online, per-swarm*
leave-one-out Shapley credit for sub-agents; this is *offline, corpus-level*
effect estimation for **promotion** decisions. They compose — CSCA can weight
which sub-trajectories feed this estimator.

## Why it's a moat

- **Sample efficiency** — learning from a debiased causal effect needs far fewer
  episodes than averaging noisy outcomes; real wins promote sooner, superstitions
  never do.
- **Explainability as a deliverable** — "+0.18 task success, CI [0.07, 0.29],
  adjusted for {domain, depth, prior-tool-success}, n=4,200, placebo 0.004",
  signed into the audit chain. No RLHF pipeline emits that.
- **Unbuyable & compounding** — the propensity/outcome structure (Phase A) and
  the transition model (Phase B) are fit on *that customer's* trajectories. Six
  months of running is a credit model a fresh competitor can't reconstruct.
- **It is the safety story** — a self-modifying system that promotes only
  causally-validated changes is the thing you can actually put in a bank.

## Phase B — model-based counterfactual rollouts (tabular version shipped)

`maverick.counterfactual_rollout` fits a **tabular transition model** over the
logged `(state, action) -> next_state` records — a discrete world-model of the
agent's own environment — and runs **g-computation**: re-simulate each starting
context with the decision's action forced to `treated` vs `control`, roll
forward under the learned dynamics + observed behaviour policy to a terminal
outcome, and difference the two. It returns the **same**
`EffectEstimate(effect, ci, trustworthy)`, so `propose_with_effect` and the gate
are unchanged — only the estimator behind them got stronger.

**Why it earns its place:** g-computation identifies an effect that
stratification *structurally cannot*. When the behaviour policy confounds the
decision deterministically (zero overlap in every Phase-A stratum), Phase A is
honest but blind. Phase B still recovers it, because the action varies *somewhere*
in the corpus and the effect is composed from one-step transitions that DO have
support. The test battery demonstrates exactly this contrast.

**The one assumption, stated honestly:** g-computation is unbiased only if the
state captures everything that confounds action with outcome (no unobserved
confounding *given the model's state*). So it is **fail-closed by calibration** —
`trustworthy` requires the model to predict held-out one-step transitions
(`one_step_accuracy >= min_accuracy`), both actions to have real support, and a
null-action placebo (treated vs treated, which must be ~0). An uncertain
simulator never greenlights a promotion.

This is the learning half of the **Operating Twin**: the per-customer
world-model that *also* powers pre-execution rehearsal (the governance half,
below). A generative transition model is a drop-in replacement for the tabular
one behind the same interface.

## Governance half — pre-execution rehearsal (shipped)

The same world-model powers counterfactual *foresight*. `maverick.rehearsal`
takes a fitted `TransitionModel` and, before a risky plan executes, Monte-Carlo
rolls it forward to a predicted outcome and gates on it:

- **proceed** — the model has support and confidently predicts a good outcome.
  Let the agent be bold (less friction than a blanket approval gate).
- **block** — the model confidently predicts a *poor* outcome.
- **escalate** — the rollout is too uncertain, or — crucially — the model has
  **no support** for this action in this state. A simulator that bluffs about the
  unknown is worse than none, so an unseen move is escalated to a human / canary,
  never waved through and never silently blocked.

This is governance as a *capability*, not just a brake: confidence buys boldness,
ignorance buys a human. The verdict (`RehearsalVerdict.decision`) maps onto the
existing escalation surfaces (consent / autonomy gate). OFF by default and
fail-open (`[rehearsal] enable`); when on it fails toward caution — unknown,
over-uncertain, or an internal error all escalate. Live wiring into the agent
action loop (which actions to gate, the state encoder, model-refresh cadence) is
a deliberate follow-up seam; the engine + gate policy ship here, fully tested.
