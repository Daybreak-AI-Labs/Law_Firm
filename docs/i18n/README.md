# Translated documentation

Community-maintained translations of the Lightwork user docs. The English files under [`docs/`](../) are always authoritative; translations may lag behind them.

## Languages

| Code | Language | Translated so far |
|---|---|---|
| `es` | Español | [getting-started.md](./es/getting-started.md) |
| `ja` | 日本語 | [getting-started.md](./ja/getting-started.md) |
| `de` | Deutsch | [getting-started.md](./de/getting-started.md) |
| `fr` | Français | [getting-started.md](./fr/getting-started.md) |
| `pt-BR` | Português (Brasil) | [getting-started.md](./pt-BR/getting-started.md) |
| `ko` | 한국어 | [getting-started.md](./ko/getting-started.md) |
| `ru` | Русский | [getting-started.md](./ru/getting-started.md) |
| `it` | Italiano | [getting-started.md](./it/getting-started.md) |
| `hi` | हिन्दी | [getting-started.md](./hi/getting-started.md) |

Only `getting-started.md` is translated so far.

## How staleness is tracked

Every translated file starts with an HTML comment (in the target language) naming the source file and the short git commit hash of the English revision it was translated from. To check whether a translation is stale, compare that hash against the current hash of the English source:

```bash
git log -1 --format=%h -- docs/getting-started.md
```

If they differ, the English page changed after the translation was made. When you update a translation, refresh the hash in its header.

**Note on links:** link targets are kept byte-identical to the English source, so relative links inside a translation (for example `./configuration.md`) still refer to the English documentation until a translated counterpart exists.

## Contributing a new language

- **Docs (this directory):** copy the English page into `docs/i18n/<lang>/` (BCP 47 code, e.g. `es`, `pt-BR`), translate the prose, and leave code blocks, inline code, file paths, env var names, config keys, URLs, and product names untranslated. Add the source-commit header comment described above, and add your language to the table in this README. `packages/maverick-core/tests/test_docs_i18n_files.py` enforces the basics.
- **Dashboard UI strings:** these are not managed here — contribute them through the dashboard i18n portal, `maverick_dashboard/i18n_portal.py`.

## Machine translation for additional languages

Languages beyond this hand-maintained set ride the docs i18n pipeline module:

```bash
python -m maverick.docs_i18n
```

Machine output is a starting point only — have a native speaker review it against the quality bar of the translations in this directory before merging.
