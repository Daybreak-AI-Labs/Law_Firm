# Contributing to Lightwork

Thanks for being here. Lightwork is built by accretion -- every commit
should make the foundation stronger without forcing a rewrite. Read
these guidelines before opening your first PR.

## Quick start (dev setup)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Daybreak-AI-Labs/Lightwork
cd maverick
# Core + the full dev/test toolchain (pytest, ruff, pre-commit, and the
# cross-package runtime deps the suite imports) in one shot:
pip install -e './packages/maverick-core[dev]'
# Sibling packages are import-time deps of the suite (installed --no-deps;
# their runtime deps come from [dev] above at the floors CI enforces):
pip install --no-deps -e ./packages/maverick-shield
pip install --no-deps -e ./packages/maverick-channels
pip install --no-deps -e ./packages/maverick-dashboard
pip install --no-deps -e ./packages/maverick-mcp
pip install --no-deps -e ./apps/installer-cli
pre-commit install

pytest -q
```

Make sure `maverick --help` works and `maverick doctor` prints a
status table. `pre-commit install` wires the lint gate (below) to run on
every commit, so you catch a ruff failure locally instead of in CI.

New capability → new package under `packages/`. New entry point → new
app under `apps/`. The wizard MUST learn to enable any new capability,
or non-technical users can't reach it.

## House rules

1. **Surgical changes.** Don't "improve" adjacent code. Match existing
   style even if you'd do it differently.
2. **Shield wired or it doesn't count.** If you add a new tool / sink,
   it goes through `ctx.shield.scan_tool_call()` before execution.
3. **Budget caps are non-negotiable.** Every long-running path must
   respect `Budget`. No bypassing `budget.check()`.
4. **Sandbox-mediate all shell.** Never call `subprocess.run` from a
   tool directly -- go through `sandbox.exec()`.
5. **Per-role model choice is user-controlled.** Never hardcode a model
   in the agent loop. Read from `maverick.config.get_role_model(role)`.
6. **Fail-open with a warning, never silently.** A broken scanner or
   missing optional dep must log loudly.
7. **Defaults belong in code; overrides in `~/.maverick/config.toml`.**

## Tests

- Every package has a `tests/` directory with `test_*.py` files.
- Use the `FakeLLM` fixture in `packages/maverick-core/tests/conftest.py`
  for any test that touches the agent loop -- never burn API credits in CI.
- Tests run via `pytest -vvs --tb=long` in CI on Python 3.10/3.11/3.12.

## Continuous integration (read before merging)

**A PR is not mergeable until every required check is green.** Don't merge
on a red or still-running pipeline -- a single broken check on `main`
blocks everyone. The required checks are:

| Check            | What it runs                                                        |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `lint`           | `ruff check .` (whole repo) + a grep rejecting bare `import tomllib` |
| `lint-pr-title`  | Conventional-Commit PR title (see below)                            |
| `test (3.10/.11/.12)` | the full `pytest` suite on each interpreter                     |
| `audit`          | `pip-audit` against the dependency graph                            |
| `docker`         | the deploy image builds                                             |

Two recurring foot-guns, both enforced by CI:

1. **`ruff check .` runs on the whole repo, not just your diff.** An unused
   import you orphaned in another file fails lint for *everyone*. Run
   `pre-commit run --all-files` (or just `ruff check .`) before you push --
   `pre-commit install` makes this automatic on commit.
2. **`import tomllib` needs the 3.10 fallback.** `tomllib` is 3.11+ stdlib;
   importing it bare breaks the 3.10 leg of the matrix. Use the
   `try/except ModuleNotFoundError: import tomli as tomllib` pattern from
   `CLAUDE.md`.

**PR titles** must be Conventional Commits (`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`,
`refactor:`, `test:`, `chore:`, `perf:`, `ci:`) **and the subject after the
prefix must start with a letter** -- not a digit, quote, or backtick
(`feat: 2027 roadmap` fails; `feat: add the 2027 roadmap` passes).

## Adding a provider

1. Create `packages/maverick-core/maverick/providers/<name>_provider.py`
   with a class implementing `complete()` and `complete_async()` that
   accept Anthropic-format messages/tools and return `LLMResponse`.
2. Register in `packages/maverick-core/maverick/providers/__init__.py`
   under `get_provider_client` and `KNOWN_PROVIDERS`.
3. Add to the wizard catalog at
   `apps/installer-cli/maverick_installer/models.py`.
4. Add tests for any format-translation logic.

## Adding a channel

1. Subclass `Channel` in `packages/maverick-channels/maverick_channels/<name>.py`.
2. Wire it in `server.py` (`_wire_<name>` + `_WIRES` dict).
3. Add to the wizard `CHANNELS` list.
4. Document setup steps in `docs/deployment.md`.
5. If it needs a Python SDK, add to `pyproject.toml` optional extras.

## Adding a skill

Write a `SKILL.md` (see `benchmarks/example-skills/README.md` for the
schema) and put it in `benchmarks/example-skills/`. Users install with
`maverick skill install gh:...`.

## Commit style

- Conventional commit subject (`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`,
  `test:`, `chore:`).
- Body explains the *why*, not the *what*. The diff shows what.
- Reference the council finding or issue if applicable.

## Reporting bugs

Use the issue templates. Include `maverick doctor` output and the
relevant section of your `~/.maverick/config.toml` (with secrets
redacted).
