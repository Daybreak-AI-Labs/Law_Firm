"""The seam between the DSAR Concierge agent and the Lightwork platform.

The agent's record of truth is always the vendored ``dsar_engine`` store —
the same files whether standalone or platform-bundled, so an upsell never
migrates data. What the platform ADDS is mirrored through here: the request
also lands in the governed privacy workspace registers, every step hits the
signed audit chain, and fulfillment can use the platform's real
subject-data export machinery. Standalone, those calls are silent no-ops
and email delivers to the in-process capture inbox.
