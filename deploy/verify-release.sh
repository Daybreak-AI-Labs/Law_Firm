# Verify a Lightwork release artifact's Sigstore (cosign keyless) signature.

# Every release binary, standalone source archive, checksum manifest, and SBOM
# ships with a detached `.sig` (signature) and `.pem` (signing certificate).
# The signature is keyless: it was produced by the
# release workflow's OIDC identity and logged to the public Rekor transparency
# log, so verification proves the artifact was built by THIS repo's release
# workflow for the expected release tag -- no shared public key to distribute or
# trust on faith.

# Pass the release tag you intend to install (for example, v1.2.3). Verification
