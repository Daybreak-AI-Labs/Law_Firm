"""Control/data-plane soak: prove the dispatch substrate holds under concurrent
load (roadmap follow-through on the e2e harness).

``control_data_plane_e2e`` proves one goal runs out-of-process. This drives
*many* goals through the real control plane (``QueueDispatcher`` -> SQLite
``JobQueue``) and a pool of concurrent ``Worker`` loops -- each its own queue and
world connection, standing in for separate worker processes -- and asserts the
substrate's load-bearing guarantees:

* **Zero loss** -- every enqueued goal reaches a terminal ``done``.
* **Exactly-once** -- no goal is executed twice. This is the real contention
  test: ``JobQueue.claim`` flips ``pending -> running`` with a guarded
  ``UPDATE ... WHERE status='pending'``, so two workers racing the same row
  resolve to one winner. A duplicate here would mean the guard is broken (double
  work, double spend). SCOPE: this is DB-level exactly-once on the CLAIM path
  only. It does NOT exercise the reclaim path, which is at-least-once for side
  effects -- a worker frozen past its lease can have its job reclaimed and re-run
  by a peer, so handlers must be idempotent. See the CAVEAT where the metric is
  computed.
* **Drains clean** -- no job left ``pending``/``running``; no worker raised.

No Redis/gRPC network and no LLM: execution is stubbed at the same boundary as
the e2e harness, so this measures the *plumbing under concurrency*, not the agent
loop. Returns a JSON-able evidence dict (``proof.ok``); ``--ci`` fails the build
if a guarantee breaks; ``--out`` writes the artifact.
