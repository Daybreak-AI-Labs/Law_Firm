"""Consent ergonomics pass (roadmap: 2028 H2 Safety).

Better consent UX **without weakening the gate**. Three ergonomic wins layered on
top of :mod:`maverick.safety.consent` — never around it:

  * **Batch** related pending prompts into one grouped ask, so "delete these 8
    files" is one decision, not eight identical interruptions.
  * **Plain-language summary** of what's being requested (same friendly-verb
    style as the ``plain_language`` tool), so a non-technical operator
    understands the ask.
  * **Session memory**: remember "ask once per session for this exact
    request/policy fingerprint in an injected, expiring session store. This is **not** a
    persistent grant — it lives only for the session, has a TTL, and is a cache
    of *a decision the human already made this session*, re-checked, never a way
    to skip a first decision.
  * **Dry-run preview**: render exactly what would be asked/auto-remembered
    without prompting anyone.

Safety invariants:
  * The real decision is always produced by ``consent.require_consent``; this
    module composes a callable around it and never returns a grant the consent
    primitive didn't make.
  * Session memory only *replays* a prior **granted** decision from this session
    (denials are never cached — a denied action is re-asked). It expires, and is
    scoped to the injected store the caller owns (clearing the store = forgetting
    everything), so it can't become a back-door persistent grant.

Deterministic and offline: the session store, clock, and the consent function are
all injectable, so grouping / summaries / expiry are unit-tested without a TTY,
the audit log, or the consent ledger.
