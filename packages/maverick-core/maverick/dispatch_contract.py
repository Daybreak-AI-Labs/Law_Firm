"""CI gate: tool dispatch must go through an authorization gate.

``Agent._run_tool`` runs eleven ordered gates before a tool executes. It is not
the only way into the tool registry: a census found four dispatch sites and one
gated. The live ungated one (``flow/execution.py``, bound at
``automation_queue``) reached every registered connector -- stripe, gmail, s3,
salesforce, sap, workday -- with a partial check and no audit row.

The missing audit row is the structural problem, not just the missing checks.
The attestation bundle asserts that *no recorded action violated the policy
envelope*; an action dispatched through an ungated path is never recorded, so
it satisfies that sentence by construction. That turns the platform's central
governance claim from incomplete into **unfalsifiable**, and a claim a hostile
auditor cannot attack is not a strong claim.

This gate keeps the property: a new ``registry.run(...)`` outside the sanctioned
sites fails the build, so the next dispatch site cannot be added ungated by
accident. It is deliberately a structural check rather than a grep -- a grep for
``.run(`` matches hundreds of unrelated calls.

CLI: ``python -m maverick.dispatch_contract --ci``.

Vacuous-gate protection: exits non-zero if it inspects zero files, and if it
cannot find the agent's own known-good dispatch (which proves the detector still
recognises the shape it is looking for).
