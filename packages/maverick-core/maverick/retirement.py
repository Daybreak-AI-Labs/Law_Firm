"""Governed retirement of an AI system/component -- the far end of the lifecycle.

ISO/IEC 42001 A.6.2 spans the whole AI system life cycle, and the one stage the
rest of this codebase did not yet close is *retirement*: the deliberate,
recorded decommissioning of a system, model role, or learned capability that is
no longer fit for use. Promotion is governed (``learning_rollout``); retirement
must be too, or a system can simply stop being used with no provable end-of-life.

This module makes retirement a first-class, audited act:

  - It records a signed ``AI_SYSTEM_RETIRED`` audit row (who decided, why, and
    what happens to the data) so the Operating Record shows the end-of-life the
    same way it shows learning promotions.
  - It honours an explicit *data disposition* -- ``retain`` / ``archive`` /
    ``erase`` -- so retirement and data lifecycle are decided together.

The pure orchestration (:func:`retire_system`) is deterministic and offline-
tested with injected archive/dispose/record/clock callables; :func:`retire_system_live`
wires the real signed audit row and (for ``archive``) a learning-state snapshot.
Invoked deliberately by an operator -- nothing auto-retires, so the kernel is
unchanged out of the box, exactly like ``learning_rollout``.
