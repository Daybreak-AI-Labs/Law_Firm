"""Chaos game-day script (roadmap: 2028 H2 performance).

The chaos harness (:mod:`maverick.chaos`) injects faults; a *game day* is the
drill that uses it: a scripted sequence of fault scenarios run against a
work-shaped probe, each verifying the resilience property it targets — "tool
dispatch flakes at 20%: did retries absorb it?", "the LLM fails outright:
did the run degrade to a terminal status instead of hanging?".

Deterministic by construction (the chaos PRNG is seeded), offline (the probe
is a scripted callable, not a live model), CI-runnable:
``python -m maverick.chaos_gameday`` exits 1 if any scenario's resilience
property does not hold — the drill you run before relying on the recovery
paths in production.

The default probe exercises the real retry layer
(:mod:`maverick.tool_reliability`) under injected ``tool_dispatch`` faults.
Operators add scenarios for their own deployment in a copy of this script;
the point of a game day is rehearsing *your* failure modes.

Run it as a STANDALONE drill (CI job or terminal), not inside a serving
process: backoff virtualization patches ``asyncio.sleep`` for the drill's
duration (restored in ``finally``), which would distort concurrent work.
