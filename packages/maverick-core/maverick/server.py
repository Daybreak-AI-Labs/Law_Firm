"""Channel-driven server mode.

``maverick serve`` starts a long-running process that:
  - reads enabled channels from config (Telegram, Discord, Slack, Signal,
    WhatsApp, SMS, Email, Matrix, iMessage)
  - listens on each one
  - for each incoming message, creates a goal and dispatches the swarm
  - sends the final result (or a truthful queued acknowledgement) via the same channel

Each user gets their own goal/episode in the world model so context is
preserved across messages. Budget caps still apply per-message.

Safety: input and output are run through Agent Shield if installed.
Tool-call scans happen inside the agent loop (see agent.py). All scans
fail open with a warning if shield isn't available.

Resilience: each channel runs in its own asyncio task. A single channel
crashing logs an error but doesn't take the others down.
