"""Operational alerts — page an operator on INFRASTRUCTURE events (killswitch
trip, budget exhaustion, audit-chain break, ...), distinct from the agent-task
deliverable notifications.

Every existing notification/webhook seam is wired to agent-task lifecycle
events; nothing paged an SRE when the killswitch tripped or a budget cap blew.
This is that seam: a single :func:`alert` entry point that, when enabled, routes
an operational event through the operator's existing notification transport
(:func:`maverick.notifications.notify`) at high priority.

**Off by default** (outward-facing). Enable with ``[alerts] enabled = true`` /
``MAVERICK_ALERTS=1``. When disabled — or if delivery fails — :func:`alert` is a
strict, non-raising no-op so it can be called from anywhere (including the
killswitch and the budget guard) without ever blocking the path it observes.
