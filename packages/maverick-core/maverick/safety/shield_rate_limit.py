"""Per-goal rate limit on shield scans (roadmap: 2027 H2 safety).

A prompt-injected loop can make an agent call the shield on every iteration —
thousands of scans for one goal. When the Agent Shield SDK is remote that is
real latency and real money; even locally it starves the loop. This module
puts a sliding-window cap on *scans per goal* so one runaway goal can't
hammer the chokepoint, while other goals' scans proceed untouched.

IMPORTANT — fail-open direction
===============================
When :meth:`ShieldRateLimiter.allow` returns ``False``, the caller must
**skip the shield scan and let the text through with a warning** — never
block the agent and never fail the tool call. The shield itself is a
fail-open chokepoint, not a hard dependency (CLAUDE.md rule 1); a rate
limiter wrapped around it inherits that direction. Throttling trades a
window of *unscanned* traffic for keeping the agent alive — the warning
log / ``on_throttle`` callback is what tells the operator that trade
happened. Do not invert this: a limiter that blocks turns a cost-control
knob into a denial-of-service of our own agent.

Usage shape::

    limiter = shield_rate_limit.shared()
    if limiter is None or limiter.allow(goal_id):
        verdict = shield.scan(text)          # normal path
    else:
        log.warning("shield scan skipped (rate limit) goal=%s", goal_id)
        verdict = None                       # treat as allowed

Throttle observability: ``on_throttle(goal_id, suppressed)`` fires on the
*first* suppressed call of a window (``suppressed == 1``, timely signal) and
then at most once per ``per_seconds`` per goal while the hammering continues,
each time carrying the number of calls suppressed since the previous alert —
so every suppressed call is reported in exactly one alert and a hot loop
can't turn the alert channel itself into spam. Callback exceptions are
swallowed (observers must never break the agent path).

Default OFF. Opt in via config (env wins over the ``[safety]`` table)::

    [safety]
    shield_rate_limit = "100/60"   # 100 scans per 60s sliding window, per goal

    # env override: MAVERICK_SHIELD_RATE_LIMIT="100/60" (or "off" to disable)

:func:`shared` returns the process-wide limiter built from that config (or
``None`` when unconfigured — the common case); :func:`reset_shared` drops it
for tests/config reload. A bad spec disables the limiter with a warning
(fail-open), it never raises into the agent loop. Stdlib-only, thread-safe,
clock injectable for deterministic tests.
