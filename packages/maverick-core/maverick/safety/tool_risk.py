"""Per-tool risk levels + per-identity max-risk ceiling.

Each tool has a coarse risk level -- ``low``, ``medium``, or ``high``.
A deployment can cap what a given context may reach by setting a
``max_risk`` ceiling; tools whose risk exceeds the ceiling are dropped
from the registry (in addition to the explicit allow/deny lists in
``tool_acl``).

Config (``~/.maverick/config.toml``):

    [security]
    max_risk = "medium"          # global ceiling (optional)

    [security.channels.telegram]
    max_risk = "low"             # nothing destructive over Telegram

    [security.users."tg:12345"]
    max_risk = "high"            # this user is trusted

    [security.tool_risk]
    my_plugin_tool = "high"      # override / classify a tool
    "mcp_*"        = "medium"    # glob -- relax MCP tools (they default to high)

Default ceiling is *unset*, meaning no cap (all risk levels allowed), so
behaviour is unchanged unless a ceiling is configured.
