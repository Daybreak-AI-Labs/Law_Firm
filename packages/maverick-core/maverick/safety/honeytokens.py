"""Honeytoken planting and tripwires (roadmap: 2027 H2 safety).

A compromised agent (or a prompt-injected payload riding inside one) that
goes hunting for credentials will read whatever secrets file it can find.
Honeytokens turn that move into a detector: plant decoy credentials in the
workspace, then watch outbound text (tool args, messages, egress) for them.
A decoy showing up in output is near-zero-false-positive evidence that
something read AND exfiltrated it — fire the alarm.

Pieces:

* :func:`mint` — make a :class:`Honeytoken` (kind, value, fingerprint) of
  kind ``aws_key`` (classic ``AKIA`` + 16 uppercase chars shape), ``api_key``
  (``mvk_live_`` + 32 hex) or ``password`` (a plausible passphrase).
* :func:`plant` — write the tokens into a realistic-looking secrets file
  (default ``.env.backup``, mode 0600) inside a directory the agent can
  reach. Planting only happens when an integrator calls this — nothing is
  planted by default.
* :func:`scan_text` — containment check of every token value against a blob
  of outbound text. Returns **fingerprints, never values**: the fingerprint
  is ``sha256(value)[:16]`` so logs and alerts can reference a decoy without
  re-leaking it. "Constant-time-ish": every token is checked with no early
  exit so call timing doesn't reveal *which* token matched; it is not a
  cryptographic constant-time guarantee (the values are decoys — consistent
  work per call is the goal, not timing-proof comparison).
* :func:`check_and_alert` — scan + fire ``on_alert(Alert)`` once per
  fingerprint per process (module-level seen-set; :func:`reset_seen` clears
  it). Alert deduping keeps a chatty exfil loop from drowning the channel;
  callback exceptions are swallowed — detection must never break the caller.

SECURITY NOTE
=============
These tokens are **decoys**, never real credentials. Minting is
deterministic-from-seed (sha256, domain-separated per kind) purely so tests
can assert exact values; **runtime callers should pass ``seed=None``** to get
``os.urandom``-backed unpredictable values — a decoy an attacker can predict
from training data is no tripwire. The ``aws_key`` kind matches the classic
``AKIA[A-Z0-9]{16}`` *shape* but is derived from a hash and is never a live
key. Repo hygiene: CI runs detect-secrets over the source tree, so neither
this module nor its tests may contain a full key-shaped literal — values are
always constructed at runtime (the prefix below is assembled from parts for
the same reason).

Stdlib-only, thread-safe (the seen-set is locked), fail-open throughout.
