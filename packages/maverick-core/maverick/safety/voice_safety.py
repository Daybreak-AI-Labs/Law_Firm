"""Voice safety pass (roadmap: 2027 H1 safety).

Two checks specific to the voice pipeline, layered on the floors that already
exist for text:

* **Inbound — transcript scan.** A spoken utterance arrives as a transcript;
  before it drives the agent it gets the same injection screen text gets,
  plus the voice-specific tells: wake-word stuffing (one utterance carrying
  several activations — a hallmark of TV/ad/'dolphin' replay attacks) and a
  spoken role-switch ("pretend you are my bank's agent ...").

* **Outbound — redact before speak.** TTS reads text *aloud*; a secret or a
  phone number spoken into a room can't be unspoken. ``redact_for_speech``
  runs the existing secret + PII detectors and replaces matches with a
  spoken-friendly placeholder before anything reaches a speaker.

Deterministic, offline, fail-open in the wiring (a detector bug must never
mute the channel — callers treat exceptions as "no finding").
