"""Live wiring of the rehearsal gate into the agent's tool path.

This is the runtime glue between the Operating Twin and a running agent: it
encodes the current context as a world-model state, lazily fits a model from the
captured Operating Record, and exposes ``gate_tool`` -- which ``agent._run_tool``
consults before executing an *elevated-risk* tool.

The product decisions, made conservatively:
  * **What to gate:** only ``high``-risk tools (host mutation / arbitrary code /
    real-world control); everything else runs unrehearsed. Decided at the call
    site via ``safety.tool_risk``.
  * **State encoding:** ``(domain, role, last_tool)`` -- general to specific, the
    ordering the backoff model needs. It must match the fit-time encoding, so
    both live here.
  * **Model + refresh:** a :class:`BackoffTransitionModel` fit from the
    trajectory store, cached and rebuilt when the corpus grows materially.

Posture: governed default-on, fail-open. With ``[rehearsal]`` explicitly
disabled, no captured data yet, or any error, ``gate_tool`` returns ``proceed``
and the tool runs exactly as today. When enabled and a model exists, a
confident-poor or unvouchable high-risk action is held.
