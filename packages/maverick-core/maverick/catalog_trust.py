"""Shared trust gates for installable catalog items (skills and templates).

Both :mod:`maverick.skills` and :mod:`maverick.templates` install
publisher-supplied content fetched from an unauthenticated host, so both run
the same two-stage trust pipeline before persisting:

  1. an Ed25519 *signed-publisher* check (:func:`verify_signed_catalog_item`),
     anchored on the operator's ``[skills].trusted_pubkeys`` / ``require_signed*``
     policy; and
  2. a *Shield content scan* (:func:`shield_scan`) of the prompt surface, which
     fails open (with a warning) when the Shield is absent or errors.

These used to be copy-pasted in each module and had already drifted (the
canonical-bytes binding diverged once as a near-miss). The signing *policy*
genuinely differs between the two callers -- skills allow trust-on-first-use
for free-text installs, templates treat any configured trust anchor as
requiring a signature -- so the shared verifier takes the resolved policy
(``must_verify`` / ``require_anchor``) and the item's canonical signed bytes as
parameters rather than re-deriving config itself. That keeps a single
implementation of the *mechanism* while each caller keeps its own *policy*.

    ``item`` is the noun used in error messages ("skill"/"template"). ``sig`` /
    ``pubkey`` are the item's claimed signature, ``canonical_bytes_fn`` produces
    the exact bytes the publisher signed over (each item type binds a different
    field set, named in ``fields`` for the error message), and ``trusted`` is the
    configured publisher allow-list.

    Two policy decisions are supplied by the caller so this stays mechanism-only:

      - ``must_verify`` -- reject an *unsigned* item (the caller's
        ``require_signed`` / ``require_signed_catalog`` / trust-anchor policy);
      - ``require_anchor`` -- reject a *signed* item when no ``trusted_pubkeys``
        anchor is configured (a self-asserted signature is integrity, not
        authenticity).

    Returns ``True`` iff a real Ed25519 signature verified against a trusted
    publisher (the genuine "verified" status); ``False`` means the item installs
    unsigned under trust-on-first-use. Raises ``ValueError`` on any policy
    violation. When ``cryptography`` is absent, a signed item is rejected because
    trust cannot be established safely.
