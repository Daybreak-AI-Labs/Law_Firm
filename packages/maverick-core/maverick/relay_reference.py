"""Self-hosted relay reference (ROADMAP 2027 H2 Distribution).

A reference implementation of the self-hostable relay that fronts inbound
webhooks -- the OpenClaw-bridge pattern from the ROADMAP's Even-Realities-G2
"bring your own agent" note. OpenClaw's bridge is a Cloudflare Worker (a hosted
dependency); ours ships as framework-agnostic *logic* you run as a Worker OR a
small local/edge service (see ``docs/self-hosted-relay.md``).

The relay's whole job is the **quick-vs-ack-then-run split** on a deadline-
constrained device (the G2's ~30 s budget):

  * **Quick query** (a fact, short chat) -> proxied synchronously to the agent
    and answered inside the deadline.
  * **Long task** (``write.*code | research | deploy ...``) -> answered
    *immediately* with an ack ("Got it! ... result will be sent to Telegram"),
    forwarded to the existing inbound ``POST /webhook/start`` to run in the
    background, and the full result later delivered to a **secondary channel**
    (Telegram) via the outbound webhook seam.

Everything here is pure logic with **injected transport** so it unit-tests with
no server, no network, no agent:

  * ``classify_request`` -- regex-configurable QUICK vs ACK_THEN_RUN decision.
  * ``RelayConfig`` -- the deadline, the long-task pattern, the start URL, the
    secondary-channel target, and an optional HMAC secret.
  * ``Relay`` -- orchestrates: it takes an injected ``sync_handler`` (drives the
    agent for quick queries), ``starter`` (POSTs to ``/webhook/start``), and
    ``deliver`` (the outbound-webhook secondary-channel seam). It enforces the
    deadline on the sync path and falls back to an ack if the agent is slow.

The real wiring (FastAPI route, ``httpx`` POST, ``maverick.webhooks.fire`` for
delivery) lives at the edges and is the caller's to plug in; the doc shows both
the Worker and the local-service shapes.
