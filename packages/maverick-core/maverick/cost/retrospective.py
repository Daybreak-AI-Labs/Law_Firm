"""Cost retrospective (roadmap: 2028 H2 UX).

A spend total tells you *how much*; a retrospective tells you *where it went
and what to do about it*. This reads the world model's per-goal/episode spend
and produces a structured review: the costliest goals, how much went to
**failed** work (spend with nothing to show), how concentrated spend is (a few
goals dominating), and rule-based observations an operator can act on.

Deterministic and offline — every number is an aggregation over the recorded
episodes, so it is tested against a seeded world with no model in the loop.
``maverick cost-retro`` prints it. (The "AI" upsell — a narrated summary — can
sit on top of this structured core, but the core is what's trustworthy.)
