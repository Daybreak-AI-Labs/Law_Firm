"""Capability provisioning -- the agent factory equips a pack at birth.

A generated :class:`~maverick.domain.DomainProfile` names the tools it needs
and carries a workflow, but a freshly drafted pack can reference a *skill*
that isn't installed or a *tool* that doesn't exist yet -- so the agent ships
with a capability hole that only surfaces mid-run when it gets stuck. This
module closes that gap as part of the factory, proactively, instead of
reactively in the loop:

  1. ANALYSE a profile for capability gaps (``analyze_profile``) -- pure,
     read-only, no LLM, no writes. Safe to run for any draft, and the natural
     thing to surface at the human-approval gate ("this pack will also pull in
     skill X and synthesize tool Y").
  2. APPLY the safe acquisitions (``apply_plan``) through the EXISTING governed
     paths: ``self_learning.acquire_skill`` for catalog skills (hash-pinned)
     and ``self_learning.write_generated_tool`` for synthesized tools
     (stdlib-only, import-validated out-of-host, consent-gated).

Posture (kernel rule 1): analysis is always safe. Application is OFF unless
``self_learning.enabled()`` AND the pack was human-approved (the same gate
``save_profile`` enforces); every per-item step fails soft so provisioning can
never block onboarding. Provisioning NEVER widens the pack's envelope -- it
only satisfies tools already inside the already-clamped ``allow_tools`` and
installs skills (which carry no tool grant of their own). The generator that
drafted the pack can't smuggle a high-impact tool in through provisioning: the
allow-list was clamped by ``intake.validate_profile`` first.
