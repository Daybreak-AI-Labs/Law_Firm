"""Auto-skill distillation v2 (roadmap: 2027 H1 capabilities).

v1 (:mod:`maverick.skill_distillation_local`) distills recent successful runs
into a ``SKILL.md`` — but it runs after *every* goal, so a learned-skills store
slowly fills with near-duplicates of the same lesson, and a one-off success can
mint a skill that never recurs. v2 adds the two quality gates that make
continuous learning actually usable:

* **gate on evidence** — don't distill from fewer than ``min_examples``
  successful trajectories (a single success is noise, not a repeatable skill);
* **dedup against the store** — don't save a skill whose content is already
  covered by one already learned (lexical **overlap/containment** over the skill
  text — the right metric when a compact candidate is checked against a fuller
  saved skill; same zero-dep / no-embedding-model approach v1 uses), so the
  store stays a set of *distinct* lessons.
* **gate on quality** — don't save a skill too generic to retrieve precisely:
  one whose content signature is mostly glue words would over-fire on unrelated
  goals and *inject noise* into warm runs — the very failure the recall
  relevance gate fights — so it is worse than no skill at all. A learned skill
  must carry enough specific signal (distinct non-glue tokens) to be matched
  precisely, or it is dropped.

Pure and deterministic: the gates take plain skill dicts / signatures, tested
without touching disk; ``distill_and_save_gated`` is the drop-in the loop calls
and checks the strict global learning stop immediately before its durable save.
