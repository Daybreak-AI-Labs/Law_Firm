"""Deconfounded effect estimation for the promotion ladder.

The self-improvement controller promotes a change when its evidence beats
baseline (``candidate_score - baseline_score``). Today that evidence is a
*correlational* aggregate -- a tool's raw success rate, a before/after eval mean
-- and in a system that rewrites **itself**, correlational credit is a
superstition pump: a change that merely co-occurs with success (because it was
tried on easier sub-goals, or alongside the decision that actually mattered)
gets promoted, reinforced, and compounded.

This module turns that evidence from a correlation into a **causal effect**. It
estimates the effect of a candidate change on task outcome from the logged
trajectory population, adjusting for confounders by *stratification*: within each
cell of comparable context, compare treated vs untreated outcomes, then average
the per-cell effects weighted by cell size (the subclassification estimator). A
cell with no overlap (only treated, or only untreated) carries no causal
information and is dropped -- and the fraction of data we *can* compare on
(``overlap``) is reported, never hidden.

It is deliberately distinct from :mod:`maverick.credit` (CSCA), which does
*online, per-swarm* leave-one-out Shapley credit for sub-agents. This is
*offline, corpus-level* effect estimation for **promotion** decisions, and the
two compose (CSCA can weight which sub-trajectories feed this estimator).

Posture (kernel rule 1): ON by default as part of governed learning. The
estimator is a pure function (usable anywhere), but the controller only
consults a causal effect when the ``[self_improvement] causal_promotion`` knob
is on. Crucially it is **fail-safe
by calibration**: an estimate built on too little overlap, or one that leaks a
non-zero effect under a placebo (treatment permuted within strata, which *must*
be ~0), is marked ``trustworthy=False`` -- and the producer refuses to promote
on an untrustworthy estimate. Promote only what you can show *caused* the win.
