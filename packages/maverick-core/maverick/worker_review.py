"""Worker performance reviews: the governed counterpart to a human review.

A hosted black-box agent can't show its work; a governed one can. This composes
a *department review* from evidence that already exists:

* **identity** — the team and its charter (:mod:`maverick.departments`),
* **delivery** — what it got done (:mod:`maverick.outcomes`),
* **authority** — exactly what the team may and may not do, read off the
  capability envelopes of its packs (the documented "capabilities and
  limitations" a buyer asks for), and
* **learning** — how much of its recent work the learned state already covers
  (:func:`maverick.hindsight.coverage_under`), so "it improves with use" is a
  number, not a claim.

Read-only and never raises on missing data: an empty record yields an honest
``insufficient_data`` learning status and zeroed delivery, never a fabricated
review.
