"""Capability negotiation at swarm boot (roadmap: 2028 H2 ecosystem).

When the swarm spawns a child agent, the child today simply *inherits* the
parent's grant attenuated to its principal — it can't ask for a *narrower,
explicit* scope ("I only need read_file + http_fetch, low risk"), and there's
no record of what was agreed. Boot negotiation adds that handshake:

* a child declares a **requested** scope (tools / max_risk / paths / hosts);
* :func:`negotiate_boot` resolves it against the parent grant **narrow-only**
  (via :meth:`Capability.attenuate`, so a child can never gain authority the
  parent lacked), reports anything the parent *couldn't* grant, and fails the
  boot when a **required** capability isn't permitted (a specialist that
  genuinely needs a tool the parent can't grant shouldn't run half-equipped);
* the result carries a serializable **record** for the audit log.

Composes with the existing capability layer (``capability.Capability``) and
the ``capability_negotiation`` tool's set logic; deterministic and offline.
No-op when capability enforcement is off (the parent grant is ``None``).
