"""EU AI Act risk-classification helper.

The EU AI Act (Regulation 2024/1689; transparency duties enforceable Aug 2 2026)
sorts AI systems into risk tiers: **prohibited** (Art. 5), **high-risk**
(Annex III), **limited-risk** (Art. 50 transparency), and minimal. The tier
determines the obligations — and the tier depends on the *use case*, which only
the operator knows.

So this helper does the honest thing: it reports what Maverick *can* determine —
the deployment's live Art. 50 transparency posture — and hands the operator a
self-assessment checklist of the prohibited and high-risk categories plus the
obligations each tier triggers. A conversational agent that discloses it is AI is
**limited-risk by default**, but the operator must rule out the prohibited and
high-risk lists for their own deployment.

Fail-soft and import-light like :mod:`maverick.ropa`. Surfaced as
``maverick ai-act``.
