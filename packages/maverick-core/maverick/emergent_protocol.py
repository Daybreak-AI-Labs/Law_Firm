"""The Emergent Substrate -- a learned, auditable coordination shorthand.

Maverick's swarms coordinate in English: every handoff, every blackboard post is
tokens through a frontier model. Most of that traffic is boilerplate the agents
say over and over. So let them **evolve their own shorthand** -- a codebook
learned from the swarm's *actual* messages (the phrases they repeat get short
codes) -- and pay frontier tokens only for what's genuinely new.

The reason this is deployable where emergent communication usually isn't: it's
**not** an opaque neural language. Every code decodes, exactly, back to the
English it stands for -- the auditable translation layer *is* the product. A
regulator (or the Shield, or a human) reads the plain text; the agents move the
compressed form. ``decode(encode(x)) == x`` is the contract, enforced by the
tests, so the shorthand can never hide meaning.

This is the codec + codebook learning. The hot encode/decode path is the natural
Rust->WASM carve (per the language plan) and wiring it into the blackboard /
channels is a seam; the learned, round-trip-safe core is here. Pure + OFF by
default (``learn`` only runs on an opt-in message corpus; an empty codebook is
the identity transform -- no behaviour change).
