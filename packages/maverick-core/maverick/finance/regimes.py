"""Finance compliance-regime packs (finance-agent-suite §5).

Same pattern as the EU-AI-Act / NIST packs: each regime compiles to a governance
:class:`~maverick.governance.Policy` (what *must* pause for a human or be denied)
plus a plain-text assertion of what it covers. Selecting several regimes unions
their policies **strictest-wins** (deny beats require-human, the lowest risk floor
and the lowest dollar threshold win) — a US public company turns on
SOX + GAAP + SEC + PCI + AML; a private EU company swaps in IFRS.

Pure data + a pure union function, so the compilation is unit-tested. The
``finance status`` posture report (:mod:`maverick.finance.status`) surfaces which
regimes' controls are actually live. Expanded packs retain primary issuer or
legislator URLs so downstream evidence can identify the authoritative source.
