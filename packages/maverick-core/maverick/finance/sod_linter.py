"""Segregation-of-Duties (SoD) conflict linter over the finance domain packs.

The cardinal finance control (finance-agent-suite §2.1): the four incompatible
duties — **record, authorize, custody, reconcile** — must never sit with one
party. We enforce it structurally: each duty is a separate compartment, and no
single compartment's capability may span two incompatible duties. This is the
static check that proves it — the finance analogue of the capability tests, meant
to gate CI so the separation can't silently rot.

Each tool maps to at most one duty by name pattern; a compartment's duties are the
union over its packs' ``allow_tools``. A compartment that holds an *incompatible*
pair (e.g. ``stage_payment_batch`` = record **and** ``release_payment`` = custody)
is a conflict. Record + reconcile in one compartment is allowed (the same closer
records and reconciles); custody and authorize are incompatible with everything.
Pure and dependency-free.
