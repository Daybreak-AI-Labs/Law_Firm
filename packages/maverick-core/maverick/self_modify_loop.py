"""DGM research-cycle driver + proof-gated surface widening (Phase 4).

This ties Phases 1-3 into a governed Darwin-Gödel-Machine research loop:
**propose → evaluate → archive**, run under the reference monitor, with the editable
surface WIDENING only as the system earns trust.

One cycle (:func:`run_cycle`):

1. **Sample a parent** to branch from (the DGM archive; :mod:`self_modify_archive`).
2. **Propose** a patch off that parent (an injected live-model seam; the offline
   default proposes nothing, so the loop is inert without a real proposer).
3. **Boundary review** (:func:`self_modify.review_patch`) — a control-plane edit
   is refused structurally, before anything is evaluated.
4. **Evaluate** on isolated copies (:func:`self_modify_eval.evaluate_patch`) —
   the empirical baseline-vs-candidate measurement.
5. **Archive without promotion** — the challenge corpus is development telemetry,
   not a sealed production evaluator. DGM keeps the *worse*
   ancestors too, because branching from a diverse population is what escapes the
   plateau.

**Proof-gated surface widening.** The surface the loop may edit is not fixed; it
starts empty and widens one tier at a time, and a tier unlocks only after the
system has accumulated *proof* at the current tier — a run of promoted,
non-rolled-back, capability-bounded changes. A single rollback (a regression that
had to be undone) blocks further widening: trust is earned by a track record and
forfeited by a failure. This is the deployable posture for regulated
environments — the agent proves it can edit a narrow surface safely before it is
allowed a wider one, and it can never widen its *own* surface (the widening
policy lives here, outside the editable surface, and the boundary refuses any
patch that touches ``self_modify``/``config``).

Posture (kernel rule 1): OFF by default and a no-op while off. The loop runs only
when BOTH :func:`self_modify.enabled` and :func:`self_improvement.enabled` are
true; otherwise every entry point returns an inert report. It never raises — a
cycle that errors returns a non-promoting report (fail closed).
