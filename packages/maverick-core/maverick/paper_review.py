"""Vendor-paper review: is it a DPA or an Addendum, where does it depart from
our standard position, and what exact language fixes it.

When a vendor insists on *their* paper, a privacy reviewer does three things by
hand: work out which instrument they actually sent, read it against our
template, and mark up the clauses that fall short. This module does all three,
with a deliberate split of authority:

* **Deterministic finds the gaps.** Which clauses are missing, weak, or
  contradicted is decided by pattern checks against a fixed checklist -- the
  Art. 28 list in :mod:`maverick.privacy_ops` for a DPA, and the CCPA/CPRA
  service-provider list here for an Addendum. A model never gets to invent a
  finding, and never gets to clear one.
* **The model only drafts prose.** Opus (via ``get_role_model("reviewer")``,
  never a hard-coded id) is asked to tailor our standard clause to the
  vendor's defined terms and numbering so the redline reads like their
  document. If it is unavailable, unaffordable, or returns something that
  drifts from our position, we fall back to our template language verbatim.
  The gap list is identical either way.
* **The instrument choice defers to the jurisdiction guard.** Classification
  here reads the document; when intake facts are known, the caller passes them
  and the deterministic jurisdiction table wins, mirroring the concierge's
  existing contract guard.

Output is a set of :class:`~maverick.docx_redline.ClauseEdit` objects plus a
reviewer-facing concern list, so the same result drives both the analysis
report and the tracked-changes document.
