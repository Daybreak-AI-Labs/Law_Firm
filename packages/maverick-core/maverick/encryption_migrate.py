"""Seal existing plaintext data after at-rest encryption is enabled.

Enabling at-rest encryption (``[encryption] at_rest``) only seals **new** writes;
rows written before are left plaintext and read back transparently (lazy
migration). This module force-seals that pre-existing plaintext so the whole
store is encrypted, not just new data. It is **idempotent** — already-sealed
values are skipped — so it is safe to re-run.

The reseal happens **in place** and shreds the pre-encryption plaintext residue
(``secure_delete`` + VACUUM). Operators who need a rollback copy may explicitly
opt in to a transactionally-consistent **plaintext backup** of the DB
(:func:`backup_world_db`).

Exposed as ``maverick encryption migrate [--dry-run] [--backup]``.
