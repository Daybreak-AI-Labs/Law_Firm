"""Data residency / region pinning (#41).

Declares the deployment's data region and the set of regions data is permitted
to live in, and -- in **strict** mode -- refuses to boot when the declared
region is missing or outside the allowed set. Without this a region pin is only
ever an agent-reasoning hint (the ``data_residency`` tool); strict mode makes it
a startup gate, so a misconfigured pin fails loudly instead of silently storing
data in the wrong jurisdiction.

Resolution (env wins over config in every case):
  - region: ``MAVERICK_DATA_REGION`` / ``[residency] region`` (e.g. ``DE``, ``EU``).
  - allowed set: ``MAVERICK_RESIDENCY_ALLOWED`` (comma-separated) / ``[residency]
    allowed_regions`` (TOML list or comma string). Group names (``EU``/``EEA``)
    expand to their members on both sides, reusing the ``data_residency`` tool's
    group table so the two never drift.
  - strict: ``MAVERICK_RESIDENCY_STRICT`` / ``[residency] strict``; default off.

Off by default and a silent no-op until an operator opts in, so the single-tenant
default and existing deployments are unchanged (kernel rule 1).

Honest scope: this pins and validates the *declared* region against policy. It
cannot inspect the physical location of every byte (no app-layer code can); it
guarantees the deployment's declared region is coherent with the allowed set and
that a strict deployment cannot boot misconfigured.
