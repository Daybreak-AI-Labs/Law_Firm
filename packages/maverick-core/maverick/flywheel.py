"""The flywheel -- one cycle that turns every engine together.

This is the live wire-up of the Cognitive Data Engine: a single pass over the
captured Operating Record that runs the whole loop, grounded in real outcomes.

    ground   -- prefer the REAL consequence (Consequence Engine) over the verifier
                proxy wherever reality has reported back, so everything below
                learns from what actually happened.
    triage   -- rank failure classes by causal impact (data_engine).
    guard    -- mine self-correcting guardrails from the harmful classes and
                refresh the registry (negative_knowledge).
    remember -- consolidate the beneficial habits into procedural memory, with the
                reinforce/forget curve (procedural_memory / the Hippocampus).
    discover -- propose swaps (harmful -> beneficial) and, if a world-model is
                supplied, validate them in simulation (operations_scientist).

``run_once`` is one turn of the flywheel; scheduled between shifts (``maverick
flywheel`` / a cron / the dashboard) the workforce compounds from its own
experience. OFF by default: ``maybe_run`` is the safe entry point, a no-op empty
report unless ``[data_engine]`` is enabled.

(This supersedes the earlier standalone ``data_engine_runner``: it composes
*every* engine, not just triage->mine.)
