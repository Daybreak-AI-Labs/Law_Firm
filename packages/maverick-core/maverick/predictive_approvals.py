"""Predictive approvals (roadmap: 2028 H2 UX).

When an operator has approved "git push to a feature branch" twenty times and
never denied it, the twenty-first prompt is friction with no signal. This learns,
per ``(action, risk_tier)``, the operator's historical approve/deny rate from the
approvals history and **suggests** a default — ``auto-approve-candidate``,
``auto-deny-candidate``, or ``always-ask`` — with a confidence that grows with
sample size.

Safety: this only ever *recommends*. It never decides, never writes to the
consent ledger, never short-circuits :mod:`maverick.safety.consent`. The output
is a suggestion surfaced to a human ("you've approved this 20/20 times — make it
auto?"), and a human (or the integrator's policy UI) acts on it. A low sample, a
mixed record, or anything risky stays ``always-ask``.

Pure and deterministic: the history is injected (a list of records, or any object
exposing the recorded approvals), so suggestions are unit-tested offline with no
world model and no clock.
