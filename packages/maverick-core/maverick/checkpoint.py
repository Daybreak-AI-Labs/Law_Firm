"""Durable execution — Phase 1: linear single-agent crash-resume.

Design: ``docs/specs/durable-execution.md``. This is the smallest shippable
slice of that spec — checkpoint a single (non-spawning) agent's loop state at
the turn boundary and resume it from the last committed step after a crash,
instead of re-running from step 0 (today's warm-restart behavior).

Scope of Phase 1 (intentionally narrow):
  - One agent (the orchestrator / a depth-0 agent that doesn't fan out). The
    swarm-tree case (spawn_swarm concurrency, per-child records) is Phase 2.
  - Checkpoints the resumable loop state: step index, the LLM ``messages``
    history, and a Budget snapshot (spent counters).
  - Append-only ``checkpoints`` table keyed by (goal_id, episode_id, agent_id, step_seq),
    in its OWN table so it needs no world-model schema-version migration.

Posture (kernel rule 1): OFF by default, fail-open. ``enabled()`` gates the
whole feature; every read/write is wrapped so a checkpoint-store error
degrades to today's warm-restart, never aborts a run.
