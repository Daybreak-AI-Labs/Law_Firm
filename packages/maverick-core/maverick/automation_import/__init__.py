"""Import clients' existing automations from other platforms into Maverick.

External automation platforms model a **trigger + ordered actions**. This
package normalizes any of them into one IR (:mod:`.ir`) via a per-platform
translator (:mod:`.base` registry), then maps the IR onto Maverick's existing
``Template`` + trigger/schedule primitives (:mod:`.materialize`).

Two import modes, by platform capability:

* **Definition import** -- platforms that expose their automation definitions
  over an API (n8n, Make, Workato, Power Automate, UiPath): fetch + translate
  the real workflow graph. ``Importer.can_fetch_definitions`` is True.
* **Connect-and-trigger** -- platforms that do NOT expose their automation
  definitions (Zapier, Notion automations): the source automation can't be
  read, so the client's tool calls into Maverick (inbound webhook) and/or we
  read its data; ``can_fetch_definitions`` is False and ``fetch`` explains.

Gated by ``[automation_import] enable`` / ``MAVERICK_AUTOMATION_IMPORT``.
