"""Canonical product-guarantee proofs — the real roster through the real
enforcement code.

Each function drives the *shipped* domain packs through the *same* primitives
the production tool chokepoint (``agent._run_tool``) calls, and returns a
human-readable detail string (raising :class:`AssertionError` on a broken
guarantee). This is the single source of truth shared by two surfaces:

* ``proof/run_proof.py`` — the standalone scoreboard CLI.
* :mod:`maverick.proof_pack` — the signed, reproducible evidence bundle.

Five guarantees run anywhere; two cryptographic ones (Ed25519) need
``cryptography`` and are reported as CI-verified otherwise. :func:`run_all`
wraps them into structured :class:`GuaranteeResult` rows for the bundle.
