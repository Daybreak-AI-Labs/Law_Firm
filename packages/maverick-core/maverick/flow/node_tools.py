"""Per-node tool-usage capture for a flow's agent nodes.

An ``agent`` node runs as a governed goal; that goal calls tools. When such a
node reliably calls exactly ONE tool, run after run, it isn't really exercising
judgement -- it's a deterministic step wearing an agent's clothes, and could be
*hardened* into an ``action`` that calls that tool directly (cheaper, auditable,
no model variance). :mod:`.evolve` already proposes hardening from grounded
success rates, but the blocker was always "which tool?" -- a human had to pick
it. This store answers that from evidence: it records the distinct tools each
agent-node run used, so the proposer can infer the tool the node has been calling
all along.

Sourced from the trajectory store (which knows a goal's tools) at the point an
agent node finishes; only populated when trajectory capture is on. Append-only
NDJSON (the node-outcomes shape): 0600, best-effort, bounded tail, never raises.
