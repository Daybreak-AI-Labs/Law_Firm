"""Append-only log of applied flow self-rewrites.

When a proposal from :mod:`.evolve` is actually applied to a flow (a node's kind
swapped), we record the event here with the timestamp and the version it produced.
That timestamp is the boundary the measurement pass (:func:`.evolve.measure`)
splits a node's outcome series around -- outcomes before the apply are the old
behaviour, outcomes at/after it are the new -- which is what lets the loop prove
whether a rewrite actually helped instead of just asserting it.

Append-only NDJSON (the node-outcomes / consequence store shape): 0600,
best-effort, bounded tail. Never raises into a request.
