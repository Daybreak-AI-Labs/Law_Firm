"""Reliability certification run (roadmap: 2028 H2 performance —
"reliability cert").

For a self-hosted enterprise deployment there is no hosted status page to
point at; the honest equivalent is a **reproducible, evidence-backed
self-certification**: run the resilience drills the repo already ships, on
this machine, against this install — and emit a certificate JSON carrying
each check's verdict, the environment fingerprint, and (when the
audit-signing key is available) an Ed25519 signature over the canonical
payload so the artifact is tamper-evident.

Checks composed (each already exists; this is the certification harness):

* **chaos game-day** (``chaos_gameday.main``) — retry-layer absorption of
  transient faults, bounded exhaustion on total outage;
* **plugin reliability drill** (``plugin_reliability.run_drill`` self-drill)
  — crash recovery / isolation / error-rate / leak properties;
* **WAL contention** — 16 concurrent writers, zero lock errors (inlined
  probe mirroring the CI audit).

(A query-plan / EXPLAIN index check is planned but not yet part of
``DEFAULT_CHECKS``.)

``python -m maverick.reliability_cert`` writes
``data_dir("reliability_cert.json")`` and exits non-zero when any check
fails — a cert is only issued for a passing run. Checks are injectable so
the harness itself is unit-tested without re-running every drill.
