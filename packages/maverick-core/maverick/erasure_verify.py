"""Differential erasure verification (roadmap: 2028 H2 safety).

A right-to-erasure (GDPR Art. 17) run that *says* it deleted a subject's data
is not the same as proving it. This verifies the claim: after an erase, the
subject must have **zero** residual records in every store this module counts,
and every required store must have been checked successfully.

The subject scan comes from :func:`maverick.dsar.export_subject_data`:
conversations, turns, goals, episodes, facts and audit events, plus
user-scoped facts and knowledge chunks added here. Complete goal-graph proof
uses a signed erasure receipt created before mutation. The receipt contains the
exact conversation, transitive descendant-goal, and episode IDs, allowing
strict post-delete counts across every goal-linked table plus live and
historical episode-derived facts even after the rows that originally
attributed those records to the subject are gone.

A bare post-hoc ``(channel, user)`` scan cannot reconstruct orphan goal IDs and
therefore never claims complete erasure: goal-linked stores are marked
indeterminate until a tenant-scoped receipt is supplied. Receipts store no raw
subject or subject-derived hash.

Within its scope the logic is sound: subject-matching is shared with the erase
path by construction ("a row that *would* be erased is a row that *is*
exported"), so a non-zero residual count is definitionally an incomplete
erasure - the same rule, read back. The operation is read-only, but its verdict
is fail-closed: an unreadable required store produces an ``indeterminate``
report, never a clean certificate.

* :func:`verify_erasure` - the post-erasure check: per-store proof status,
  residual counts and a ``clean`` verdict.
* :func:`differential` - the before/after proof: every ``after`` count is zero
  AND the erase actually removed something (some ``before`` count was > 0).
