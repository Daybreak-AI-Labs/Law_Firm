"""Plugin SDK: discover and load third-party extensions via entry_points.

External packages can register Tools, Channels, Skills, or Personas by
declaring entry_points in their ``pyproject.toml``::

    [project.entry-points."maverick.tools"]
    weather = "myplugin:weather_tool"

    discordv2 = "myplugin:DiscordV2Channel"

    [project.entry-points."maverick.skills"]
    weather = "myplugin:WEATHER_SKILL"

    [project.entry-points."maverick.personas"]
    pirate = "myplugin:render_pirate"

Each loader is forgiving: a plugin that raises at load time logs the
error and is skipped -- one broken plugin can't take the swarm down.

Council finding (Tier 0): the loader used to execute every installed
entry_point on first agent run. Anyone who `pip install`-ed a package
declaring `[project.entry-points."maverick.tools"]` got arbitrary
in-process code execution before any shield was built. Plugins now
require an explicit allowlist in config -- set ``MAVERICK_PLUGINS_ALLOW``
or ``[plugins] enabled = ["weather", ...]`` in ``~/.maverick/config.toml``.
Set ``MAVERICK_PLUGINS_ALLOW=*`` (or ``[plugins] enabled = ["*"]``) to
load everything (matches the pre-0.2 behavior). Empty / unset = no
plugins loaded.

Two further load-time controls layer on top of the allowlist:

  - **Name-squat defense.** The allowlist matches entry-point *names*, but
    any installed package can register a given name. If two distributions
    both publish the same name (e.g. an attacker shadowing ``weather``), the
    loader refuses to load it ambiguously -- the user must pin the trusted
    provider as ``[plugins] enabled = ["weather@trusted-dist"]``.
  - **Manifest permissions.** A plugin may ship a ``maverick-plugin.toml``
    (see ``plugin_manifest``) declaring the permissions it needs
    (``network`` / ``fs_write`` / ``subprocess`` / ``sensitive_envs``). The
    user grants permissions via ``[plugins] grant = [...]``. A plugin that
    requests an ungranted permission is **skipped** by default; downgrade to a
    load-with-warning with ``[plugins] enforce_permissions = false`` (or
    ``MAVERICK_PLUGINS_ENFORCE=0``).

Each plugin entry must conform to a contract:

  - ``maverick.tools``: callable that returns a ``maverick.tools.Tool``
    when invoked with no args. The tool is registered in every agent's
    base registry under its declared name.
    `maverick serve` constructs one with the handler bound).
  - ``maverick.skills``: a ``maverick.skills.Skill`` instance.
  - ``maverick.personas``: callable returning a system-prompt suffix
    string, addressed by name via ``[persona] name = "..."``.
