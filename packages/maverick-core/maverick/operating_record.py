"""The Operating Record: the firm's decisions as a system of record.

ERP capitalized money, CRM customers, HRIS people. The last uncapitalized
asset is judgment — how the company decides. The substrate already records
its raw material (goals with departments, episodes with outcomes and spend,
human approvals with deciders, the signed audit chain, the distilled
learned state); this module threads those existing stores into one
queryable spine of :class:`DecisionRecord` rows and exports the whole
operating mind as a signed, portable **capsule**.

v1 scope (deliberate): assemble + query + signed export. Merge/split (M&A
integration as a merge operation) builds on the capsule format later.
Read-only over the world model — assembling the Record never mutates what
it records. Export is Ed25519-signed with the instance's audit keypair, so
a capsule's integrity and origin are verifiable offline (the same
fail-closed pattern as the insight exchange).
