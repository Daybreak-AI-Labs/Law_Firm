"""Voice-only mode — a session loop where ALL interaction is speech.

Input is an injected source of transcribed utterances and output is an
injected ``speak(text)`` seam; every reply passes through a deterministic
speech-shaping pass (:func:`shape_for_speech`) that turns markdown/code into
something sayable ("I wrote 40 lines to app.py") before it reaches the
speaker.

Honesty notes:

* **There is no live-microphone module in this tree**, so the input seam is
  an iterable of already-transcribed utterances — the operator's mic loop
  (sounddevice + whisper, a phone bridge, ...) plugs in there. When a
  ``maverick.live_mic`` module lands, its utterance stream is the natural
  thing to pass as ``utterances``.
* **The default ``speak`` adapter synthesizes, it does not play.** It routes
  through the existing TTS path (``maverick.tools.voice``, which also applies
  the voice-safety redaction pass) and writes an mp3; audio output hardware is
  the operator's. Inject your own ``speak`` to drive real playback. The
  kernel takes no audio dependencies.

Config knob (read via the standard ``maverick.config`` pattern)::

    [voice]
    only_mode = true   # default false

``run_voice_only`` refuses to start while the knob is off (pass
``force=True`` to bypass, e.g. for tests or programmatic embedding).
