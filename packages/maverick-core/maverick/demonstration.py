"""Programming by demonstration -- synthesize a pack from a watched task.

The agent factory's other front door is *intake* ("describe the business").
This is the second: **watch a person do their job, then build the agent that
does it.** A demonstration is an ordered record of what a human did -- the
actions they took, the systems they touched, and (optionally) their narration
of why -- captured by any front-end (a screen/action logger, a narrated
walkthrough via ``live_mic``, an exported activity log). This module turns that
record into a live, sealed specialist:

    Demonstration --induce--> DomainProfile --(intake clamp)--> human approve
        --> save_profile --> provision (skills + tools) --> agent_from_profile

Induction reuses the intake safety pipeline wholesale: it produces the same
``propose(spec) -> dict`` the conversational onboarding uses, hands it to
``intake.generate_profile``, and therefore inherits ``validate_profile`` -- a
demonstrated pack can NO MORE auto-grant a high-impact tool than a described
one. The demonstration is the *evidence* a human reviews at the approval gate;
nothing activates without that yes (``save_profile`` enforces it).

Posture (kernel rule 1): no capture infrastructure is required or assumed here
-- this is the ingest + induction core. Demonstration text is treated as
untrusted (a human may have pasted a secret mid-task): step summaries are
secret-redacted before they land in the pack, and the generated persona is
shield-scanned by the intake path it flows through.
