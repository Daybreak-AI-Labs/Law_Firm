"""Client binding — one Lightwork deployment, exactly one enterprise client.

Lightwork is deployed **one instance per enterprise client** (never a shared,
hosted multi-tenant service). This module makes that binding explicit and
**fail-closed** so client data can never land in an ambiguous, un-scoped
location:

* the deployment declares its client via ``[client] id`` or
  ``MAVERICK_CLIENT_ID``;
* that id becomes the tenant **floor** (consumed by
  :func:`maverick.paths.current_tenant_id`), so every data path — world DB,
  audit chain + keys, cross-session memory, fleet memory — resolves under
  ``~/.maverick/tenants/<client>/...`` instead of a shared root. There is no
  un-scoped global location for client data to accumulate in;
* in **enforced** mode (``[client] enforce = true``, ``MAVERICK_CLIENT_ENFORCE``,
  or enterprise mode) a missing/invalid client id REFUSES to start — there is no
  silent fallback to the shared root.

Off by default (no client id configured) => legacy single-root behaviour,
byte-for-byte unchanged, so existing single-tenant installs are unaffected.

The client id is immutable for a deployment's lifetime, so it is resolved once
and cached; set ``MAVERICK_CLIENT_ID`` in the service unit / image so the hot
path (every ``data_dir`` call resolves the tenant floor) never parses config.
