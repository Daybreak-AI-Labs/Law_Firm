"""Encrypt closed audit day-files at rest (confidentiality for the audit log).

The audit log is *signed* for tamper-evidence (``signing.py``) but is otherwise
plaintext NDJSON on disk -- a confidentiality gap when the events carry sensitive
action detail. This seals **closed** day-files (any date strictly before today) in
place with AES-256-GCM, leaving the file name unchanged: a sealed segment just
holds the encrypted blob instead of NDJSON, detected on read by the seal magic
header. The **current** day-file is never sealed -- live append + the flock'd
signing writer keep operating on plaintext.

Reads stay transparent: :func:`segment_text` decrypts a sealed segment back to its
NDJSON text, so the readers (``export.iter_audit_events``) and the verifier
(``signing.verify_chain`` / the cross-file tip ledger) work on sealed and
plaintext segments alike -- and the hash-chain still verifies, because sealing
only encrypts the bytes, never the signed rows.

Exposed as ``maverick audit seal``; runs only when at-rest encryption is enabled.
