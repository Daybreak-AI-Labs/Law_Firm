"""Single source of truth for reading the tamper-evident audit NDJSON log.

Three read-side consumers used to each re-implement the same three steps with
ad-hoc globs and filename literals:

  - :mod:`maverick.audit.export` (SIEM export / ``maverick audit export``),
  - :mod:`maverick.dsar` (GDPR Art. 15/20 subject-access export),
  - :mod:`maverick.soc2` (the audit-chain compliance probe).

They drifted apart in ways that were quietly wrong -- ``dsar`` read the
cross-file ``anchors.ndjson`` tip-ledger as if it were a day-file and ignored
at-rest sealing, while ``export`` excluded the ledger and decrypted sealed
segments. This module defines, once:

  - :func:`day_files` -- what counts as a day-file (re-exported from
    :mod:`maverick.audit.signing`, where the ``YYYY-MM-DD`` pattern and the
    :data:`ANCHOR_FILENAME` constant live), so the anchor ledger is excluded the
    same way everywhere; and
  - :func:`iter_events` -- how to turn the selected day-files into event dicts,
    transparently decrypting sealed segments (:func:`maverick.audit.sealing.segment_text`)
    and skipping malformed/unreadable input (fail-soft).

Read-only: nothing here ever mutates the log or touches the signing chain.
