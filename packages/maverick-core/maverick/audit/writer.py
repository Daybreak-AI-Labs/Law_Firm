"""Audit log writer. Append-only NDJSON with daily rotation.

The writer is fail-safe by default: ordinary write errors are logged to the
regular Python logger and swallowed, because the agent kernel must never crash
because of an audit-path bug.

The one deliberate exception is :class:`~maverick.audit.errors.AuditRefused` and
its two subclasses: :class:`AuditWriteRefused` (an active compliance profile
mandates signed, tamper-evident logs and the signer will not start) and
:class:`~maverick.audit.signing.OffHostSigningRequiredError` (custody policy
forbids signing with a co-located key). In both the writer refuses rather than
silently downgrading, and that refusal is meant to reach the caller: swallowing
it converts "we could not record this action" into "we recorded nothing and did
it anyway", which is the failure the profile exists to prevent.

**Prefer :func:`audit_event` over calling :func:`record` inside your own try.**
It applies the contract for you. Catching ``Exception`` around a raw ``record()``
is the documented mistake -- and note you must catch the BASE class, because a
handler written against ``AuditWriteRefused`` alone misses the off-host refusal,
which is the one that fires under the strictest posture the product sells.
