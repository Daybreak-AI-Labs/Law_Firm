"""Federated audit-log verification (roadmap: 2028 H2 safety).

Each node/tenant keeps its own signed, hash-chained audit log
(``audit/signing.py``: per-file ``verify_chain`` + cross-file
``verify_anchors``). In a federation — multi-tenant hosting, a fleet of
workers, A2A-delegated peers — those logs *reference each other*: node A
records "delegated task T to node B", node B records "accepted task T from
node A". Single-node verification can't catch a node that **drops its half**
of a cross-node event to hide an action.

This adds the federation layer:

* :func:`collect_node` — verify ONE node's chain (reusing ``verify_chain`` /
  ``verify_anchors``) and extract its **cross-references** (events naming a
  peer node + a correlation id).
* :func:`cross_verify` — over a set of verified nodes, confirm every
  cross-reference is **reciprocated**: if A claims a link to B for correlation
  C, B's log must carry the matching counterpart. An unreciprocated reference
  (a dropped/forged half) is reported with which node is missing it.
* :func:`verify_federation` — the operator entry point: per-node integrity +
  cross-node reciprocity into one report.

Pure over already-extracted event rows (no signing key needed beyond what
``verify_chain`` already does); deterministic and offline. A node whose own
chain is broken is reported and excluded from reciprocity (you can't trust its
references).
