"""Agent-attack hunter -- sweep the audit trail for attacks by or against agents.

Every safety-relevant thing an agent does or has done to it lands in the audit
log: the shield blocking a prompt injection, the egress lock refusing a cloud
call (an exfiltration attempt), a sub-agent denied for trying to exceed its
capability grant, a governance policy firing, the kill switch. This module sweeps
that trail and aggregates those signals into a risk-rated **threat report** --
"search everywhere agents leave a trace, and surface the attacks."

The audit log is already secret-redacted before write, and only event *metadata*
(kind / agent / goal / provider / tool / reason) is summarised here -- never
payload content. Fail-soft like the audit reader it builds on.

Surfaced as ``maverick hunt`` and (next) the threat-hunter agent that investigates
each finding.
