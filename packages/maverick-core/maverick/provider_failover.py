Declare fallback model chains so a transient provider failure auto-switches to

The core `failover` / `afailover` helpers are pure "try each until success" over
callables, unit-tested with mocks; `fallback_models` reads the config (returns []
when unset -> failover is a no-op). Wiring lives in `LLM.complete` /
`complete_async`, which skip all of this entirely when no chain is configured.
