"""Workforce value report: the proof an AI workforce paid for itself AND
got better -- the artifact a POC ends on and a diligence team runs.

The platform's compounding advantage (it improves with use, safely) is real
but latent -- buried across budget receipts, episode history, the hindsight
ledger, and the signed audit log. This assembles those existing signals into
one deterministic, read-only report per department:

  * **Throughput**   -- deliverables completed (done episodes), per suite.
  * **Economics**    -- agent cost vs a human-baseline cost per deliverable
    (operator-set), i.e. cost avoided. Descriptive only -- it never tunes
    anything away (the council's warning: cost pressure must not defund
    safety).
  * **Compounding**  -- the improvement curve from the hindsight ledger
    (coverage trend over snapshots): "better than 90 days ago, here's the
    slope."
  * **Governance**   -- policy adherence from the audit log (gates honored,
    chain verifiable): the workforce stayed in-policy while doing it.

Nothing here changes agent behavior or autonomy -- it only measures. Pure
read path, no LLM, no new state; fail-open (a missing signal degrades to
"n/a", never an error). Opt-in CLI: ``maverick proof``.
