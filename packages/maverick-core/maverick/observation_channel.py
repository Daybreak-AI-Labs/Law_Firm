"""Multi-agent observation channel (roadmap: 2027 H2 capabilities).

The blackboard is a *pull* model — agents post events, readers walk the list.
This is the *push* counterpart: a read-only broadcast an external observer
subscribes to and receives the swarm's event stream **live** — a monitoring
agent, a dashboard, a supervisor watching its fleet — without joining the
control flow (unlike :mod:`maverick.agent_bus`, point-to-point and consuming).

Each subscriber gets every event published after it subscribed, in its own
bounded buffer; a slow observer drops its oldest events rather than ever
stalling the swarm (observation is best-effort). It is **no-op when unused**:
``maybe_publish`` returns immediately when there are no subscribers, so the
``blackboard.post`` tee that feeds it costs nothing on a run nobody is
watching.
