"""Build a portable attestation bundle: the wedge for moonshot Bet 1.

The Operating Record capsule (:mod:`maverick.operating_record`) already exports
the firm's decisions signed. What it cannot do is convince somebody who trusts
nobody: :func:`operating_record.verify_capsule` checks the signature using the
public key stored *inside the capsule*, which proves the file has not been edited
since signing and says nothing whatever about who signed it. Anyone can mint a
keypair and sign anything. That is integrity; a regulator, insurer or acquirer
came for provenance.

This module builds the artifact that answers them. A bundle binds three claims
to evidence somebody else can re-derive:

1. **policy_envelope** -- every recorded action stayed inside the declared
   governance envelope. Checkable because the signed chain records one
   ``tool_call`` row per executed tool, and the envelope names what was
   forbidden.
2. **bounded_self_improvement** -- the learning loop never granted itself
   authority it did not already have. Bet 1's distinctive claim, and the reason
   :class:`maverick.self_improvement.PromotionRecord` now records *how* the
   capability gate judged each promotion: the gate always refused a widening
   change, but a receipt that omits the grading leaves "proven bounded" and
   "never checked" indistinguishable to anybody reading the ledger afterwards.
3. **authentic_history** -- the decision history is intact and complete, via
   per-day content digests, chain tips and the cross-file anchor ledger.

Three rules govern what goes in, all inherited from the consequence adapters:

*Evidence, not assertion.* A claim is made only when the bundle carries what
substantiates it. Where evidence is missing the claim is issued
``INDETERMINATE`` and stays that way -- the builder never upgrades a claim it
could not support, and an empty governance policy yields ``NOT_APPLICABLE``
rather than a vacuous pass.

*The verifier is the authority.* :mod:`maverick.attestation_verify` grades the
claims and imports nothing from maverick, so the check an auditor runs on a
laptop is the same code path, not a re-implementation that might be kinder.

*Reads only.* Building an attestation never mutates what it attests to.
