"""Cross-agent message bus.

Lets agents in the same swarm communicate outside the parent/child
spawn relationship. Parent-child handoff is already covered by the
spawn tool's return value; this bus is for cousins / peers / debate
patterns where two agents at the same depth need to exchange info.

Storage: per-process in-memory queues, one per ``(namespace, agent_id)``.
The namespace is an opaque, per-swarm routing capability: agents in two
concurrent runs can use the same display id without sharing an inbox. Reads are
blocking with timeout. Writes never block. Audit-logged for the goal so the
trace shows who-told-what-to-whom.

This is intentionally tiny. Just enough plumbing to enable a few
roadmap patterns (debate, supervisor-watch, cross-task negotiation)
without committing to a heavier message-passing framework.
