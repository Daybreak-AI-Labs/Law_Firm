"""Local achievements (roadmap: 2028 H2 UX).

A small, local-only milestone ledger: achievements are *derived from the
world model's recorded history* (never self-reported, nothing leaves the
machine) and unlock exactly once. The catalog rewards the behaviors the
product actually cares about — finishing long-horizon work, using budgets,
reviewing approvals — not engagement-bait streaks.

``evaluate(world)`` checks every rule against history and persists newly
unlocked achievements to ``data_dir("achievements.json")`` (atomic, 0600)
with the unlock timestamp; ``unlocked()`` lists them. Off the hot path —
the dashboard/CLI call it on view, nothing runs per-turn.
