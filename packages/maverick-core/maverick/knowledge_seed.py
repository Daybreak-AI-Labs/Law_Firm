"""Curated regulatory starter corpora for the knowledge plane.

Ships a small, licensing-clean grounding corpus so a privacy/GRC/AI-security
specialist can cite the governing regulation out of the box instead of
retrieving nothing until a customer uploads documents. Every entry is an
ORIGINAL plain-language summary of a PUBLIC-DOMAIN framework (EU/US law and a
US-government framework), each anchored to the article/section it summarizes —
not a reproduction of copyrighted standard text. Redistributable standards
(e.g. ISO) are deliberately excluded; a customer layers their licensed copies
on top.

The documents are ingested into the suite collections the shipped packs already
point at (``itgrc`` for IT-GRC/privacy/security, ``legal`` for legal). Ingestion
runs through the normal :meth:`KnowledgeBase.ingest_text` path, so each chunk is
provenance-stamped (``source``, ``sensitivity="public"``, ``trust_tier=3``) and
content-hashed — re-seeding is idempotent per document.
