"""Workflow engine — chain tool calls into a DAG.

A workflow is a list of `Step` nodes; each step names a tool, supplies
its args (which may reference outputs from earlier steps), and declares
optional dependencies. The engine resolves the DAG, runs ready steps,
records each step's output, and lets you reference prior outputs via a
``${step_name.out}`` placeholder inside string args.

This is intentionally tiny — no checkpointing, no resume, no rollback.
It's the "glue" piece that lets the agent (or a power user) compose 3-7
existing tools into a one-shot workflow without spawning a sub-agent.

Use:

    from maverick.workflow import Step, Workflow

    wf = Workflow(steps=[
        Step("fetch", "http_fetch", {"url": "https://news.ycombinator.com"}),
        Step("snap",  "ocr",        {"op": "extract_url", "url": "${fetch.url}"}),
        Step("note",  "notify",     {"title": "OCR done",
                                       "body": "${snap.out}"}),
    ])
    result = wf.run(registry)

Cycles are rejected at construction. Output of each step is whatever
the underlying tool returned (string).
