"""Session forking: the counterfactual, kept on the Operating Record.

Agent shells let an operator branch an append-only session — "go back three
turns and try it the other way". That is a convenience for whoever is driving
the shell, and the branch that loses is thrown away. The governed version has
to answer a harder question months later, when a reviewer asks *why the agent
did A and not B*: the record has to hold both branches, not only the one that
shipped.

:func:`fork` makes the alternative first-class. It creates a NEW goal, replays
the parent's event trail up to a chosen decision point so the branch opens from
the same visible state, and records the lineage (parent, fork point, who forked
it, why) so a reviewer can read the choice and its alternative side by side
under one root.

**Nothing is re-executed.** A replayed event is a RECORD ROW copied onto the
child's trail — the same text a reviewer already read on the parent. Forking
calls no tool, spends no token, and never touches the sandbox; the child is an
empty run pre-loaded with context, driven from there like any other goal.

Lineage lives in a tenant-scoped JSON sidecar rather than a ``goals`` column.
Released world-model migrations are immutable (see
:mod:`maverick.migration_governance`), and fork provenance is metadata *about*
runs rather than part of one — so it sits beside the world as a sidecar.
A missing or corrupt sidecar degrades to "no known forks": the runs themselves are still
whole, and a lineage read must never take a review page down.
