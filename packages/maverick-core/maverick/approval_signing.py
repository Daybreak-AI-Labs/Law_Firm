"""Cryptographic human approval for high-blast-radius self-changes.

The governed promotion ladder (:mod:`maverick.self_improvement`) requires a
human at the ``code`` and ``weights`` rungs. Until now that consent was a
*self-settable boolean* (``Candidate.approved``): fine for a dev box, but it is
exactly the control a self-modifying agent could flip on its own. If the agent
can propose the code that runs the gate, a boolean it can also set is not a
control -- it's a suggestion.

This module makes the consent unforgeable and **bound to the exact change**. A
human (or a change-advisory board) signs, out of band, an
:class:`ApprovalRequest` = (candidate id, rung, payload digest) with an Ed25519
key whose PUBLIC half the deployment trusts and whose PRIVATE half never touches
the agent's process. The controller verifies that signature against the trusted
set before the human-approval gate passes. Two properties follow:

  * **Non-forgeable** -- the agent cannot mint a valid signature without the
    approver's offline private key (the reference-monitor principle: the control
    lives outside the surface the agent can rewrite).
  * **Bound to the payload** -- the digest covers the candidate's payload, so an
    approval of a benign diff cannot be replayed onto a swapped malicious one
    (TOCTOU). Change the payload, and the signature no longer verifies.

Posture: OFF by default and backward-compatible. :func:`signing_enforced`
returns False unless a deployment configures trusted approver keys (or sets the
require flag), in which case the boolean is *ignored* and a valid signature is
mandatory. When enforced, the gate fails **closed**: missing key material, an
absent ``cryptography`` install, or any verification error means "not approved",
never "approved". Reuses the audit chain's Ed25519 verifier
(:func:`maverick.audit.signing.verify_ed25519`); no new dependency.
