"""Provable redaction (roadmap: 2028 H2 safety).

The secret/PII redactors (:mod:`maverick.safety.secret_detector` /
:mod:`maverick.safety.pii_detector`) replace what they find in a single pass.
"Provable" adds the guarantee a compliance reviewer actually wants: redact to a
**fixpoint** and then *re-scan the output* to prove nothing sensitive survived.

A single pass can leave residue — overlapping/adjacent matches, or a value
only exposed once another span around it is replaced. So this iterates
redaction until a pass finds nothing left (the proof), bounded by
``max_passes``; if the bound is hit with residue still present the result is
explicitly **not proven** and the residual labels are returned, rather than
quietly handing back a partly-redacted string.

Composes the existing detectors — no new detection logic — so it inherits
their coverage. Deterministic and offline.
