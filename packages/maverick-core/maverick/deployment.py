"""Regulated-deployment profile + a live verifier for the data-boundary guarantees.

Enterprise mode, at-rest encryption, audit signing and retention each turn on a
piece of the "safe to run on private / sensitive data" posture. This module ties
them into ONE named profile (:data:`REGULATED_PROFILE`) and a verifier that
*actively exercises* the load-bearing guarantees -- it does not merely read the
config flags the way ``maverick compliance`` does. It proves the egress lock
refuses a cloud provider and that at-rest sealing actually round-trips on this
box, which is the difference between "the flag is on" and "the boundary holds"
(a flag can read ``active`` while the ``cryptography`` backend or the key is in
fact missing, which would only surface as a fail-closed error at write time).

Surfaced as ``maverick enterprise verify``.
