"""Enterprise mode — hardened defaults for working with private / sensitive data.

The kernel ships **fail-open and cloud-capable** by design (CLAUDE.md rule 1): the
shield fails open, consent auto-approves, capabilities are opt-in, and any configured
LLM provider — including a third-party cloud API — sees the prompt. That is the right
default for a personal agent. It is the *wrong* default the moment the agent is pointed
at PHI / PII / financial / regulated data, where the data leaving the boundary or an
unsupervised destructive action is exactly the exposure an enterprise cannot accept.

**Enterprise mode is one opt-in switch that makes those application defaults
fail-closed.** It blocks known LLM dispatch and supported Python HTTP client
paths; it is defense in depth, not a packet-level firewall. A deployment that
requires a hard no-egress boundary must also enforce sandbox network isolation
and host/OS/VPC egress policy.

Turn it on with ``MAVERICK_ENTERPRISE=1``, ``[enterprise] mode = true`` in
``~/.maverick/config.toml``, or the installer wizard. **Off by default** — behaviour is
exactly as before.

When on, it enforces:

- **Egress lock.** Every governed LLM call is pinned to a local / self-hosted provider
  (``ollama`` / ``vllm`` / ``tgi``, or an endpoint you allow-list under
  ``[enterprise] local_providers``). A call routed to a cloud provider
  (``anthropic`` / ``openai`` / ...) raises :class:`EgressBlocked` **before any prompt
  is sent**, and the denial is audited. This protects the governed LLM dispatch
  path. (Enforced in :func:`maverick.llm.LLM.complete`.)
- **Tool egress lock.** Outbound HTTP is held to local/private endpoints or hosts
  allow-listed under ``[enterprise] allowed_hosts`` (default-deny) on the
  supported HTTP paths. (Enforced in :mod:`maverick.egress_guard`, which wraps
  the request path of every HTTP client library the codebase uses -- ``httpx``,
  ``requests`` and ``urllib`` -- so a connector is covered whether or not its
  author called anything. Tools that surface a denial as an error string still
  call :func:`enterprise_egress_denial` directly for the better message.)

  This clause used to read "enforced at each tool's request", which was false: the
  check existed at 11 call sites while 87 of the 94 modules that make outbound HTTP
  had no gate at all, including ``gmail``, ``salesforce``, ``slack_bot`` and the
  knowledge-store embedder. It is stated here because the boundary is the property
  this mode is sold on, and the gap between the sentence and the code was three
  years wide. The remaining hole is recorded, not hidden: see
  :mod:`maverick.egress_contract`, whose CI gate fails when a module reaches the
  network through a library the guard does not wrap.

  What it still does not cover, stated so the sentence above stays honest:

  * A tool that shells out to ``curl`` or opens a raw socket. There is no
    packet-level backend (see :mod:`maverick.sandbox.network_policy`), so
    hard process-level egress is bounded by the sandbox and deployment network
    policy, not by this lock.
  * An HTTP library outside the wrapped set. The static egress-contract CI gate
    catches known production imports, but it cannot substitute for an OS/VPC
    deny rule at runtime.

  HTTPX is checked at its one-request seam, including each followed redirect
  hop. Known in-process test/mock transports are exempted by exact type; every
  unknown or custom transport is treated as network-capable and checked.
- **Consent fail-closed.** Destructive-action consent defaults to ``ask`` (and therefore
  *deny* in non-interactive contexts) instead of ``auto-approve``.
  (Enforced in :mod:`maverick.safety.consent`.)
- **Capabilities enforced.** Per-agent capability scoping + attenuating propagation is
  turned on, so a sub-agent can never exceed its grant.
  (Enforced in :func:`maverick.capability.capability_enforced`.)

An explicit env/config setting still wins for each individual control (so an operator
can, e.g., allow-list one extra self-hosted endpoint), but the *defaults* are safe and
the egress lock can never be satisfied by a cloud provider.
