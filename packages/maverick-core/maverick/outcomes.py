"""Outcome metrics: what the workforce delivered, not what it consumed.

Billing meters tokens and credits; buyers ask "what did it get *done*?" This
rolls the Operating Record (:mod:`maverick.operating_record`) up into per-worker
*outcomes* — goals completed, completion rate, spend — so a worker card can lead
with delivery ("12 of 14 goals completed this period") instead of usage. A
firm-level rollup adds human approvals and total spend across the whole record.

Read-only and pure: every number is derived from
:class:`~maverick.operating_record.DecisionRecord` rows. Honest when empty — no
records yields zeroes, never a fabricated metric.
