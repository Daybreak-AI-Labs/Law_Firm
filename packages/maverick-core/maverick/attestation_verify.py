"""Third-party verifier for a Maverick attestation bundle.

**This module imports nothing from maverick.** Standard library plus
``cryptography``, deliberately, because that is the whole point: an auditor,
regulator, insurer or acquirer who trusts *neither the operator nor the model
vendor* must be able to check the bundle without installing our platform,
reaching our infrastructure, or asking anyone's permission. ``maverick attest
export-verifier`` copies this exact file, and it runs on its own::

    python attestation_verify.py bundle.json --key <publisher-pubkey-hex>
    python attestation_verify.py bundle.json --key <hex> --evidence ~/.maverick/audit

Two things this verifier will not do, both load-bearing:

*It will not take the bundle's word for who signed it.* The signing key must
arrive out of band -- from the publisher's key page, a contract, a prior
engagement -- and the key embedded in the bundle must match it. Verifying a
signature against a key carried *inside* the signed artifact proves only that
the file has not been edited since somebody signed it; the somebody is
unconstrained. That is integrity, not provenance, and provenance is what a
third party came for. Without ``--key`` verification fails closed.

*It will not upgrade an unchecked claim into a passing one.* Each claim reports
``HOLDS`` / ``FAILS`` / ``INDETERMINATE`` / ``NOT_APPLICABLE``, and the last two
are not softer synonyms for the first. A deployment with an empty policy
envelope has no violations to find, but "nothing was forbidden, so nothing was
violated" is not a compliance finding and is never reported as one. An
encrypted-at-rest audit segment cannot be re-walked without the tenant's key, so
its history is ``INDETERMINATE`` here even though the issuer could verify it
in-house -- "the publisher checked it" is precisely the assurance this tool
exists to replace.

What ``HOLDS`` on the history claim does and does not mean: the signed rows
present are internally consistent, each row's hash covers its content, each
signature verifies under the trusted key, and the digests, tips and row counts
**the bundle committed to** still match the files -- so a removed row, an edited
row, or a deleted day-file is detectable. Note what that does not include: this
verifier never reads the issuer's anchor ledger. The anchors block travels in the
bundle because it is part of what was signed, but every check here is against the
bundle's own commitments, and a claim to have cross-checked an external ledger
would be an overclaim. It is also not a proof that nothing happened outside the
chain. No artifact can prove that; a verifier that implied otherwise would be
worse than none.
