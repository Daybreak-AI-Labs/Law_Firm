"""GDPR Article 35 — Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) generator.

A DPIA is required when processing is "likely to result in a high risk to the
rights and freedoms of natural persons" (Art. 35(1)) — and running an autonomous
agent over personal data usually qualifies. Art. 35(7) fixes the contents: a
description of the processing (a), an assessment of necessity/proportionality
(b), an assessment of the risks (c), and the measures envisaged to address them
(d).

Maverick can pre-fill the parts it knows. The differentiated half is the **risk
register**: the risks specific to running an AI agent on personal data — data
egress to an LLM, unsupervised automated action, audit tampering, indefinite
retention — each mapped to the Maverick control that mitigates it and whether
that control is *active right now* (read live from the compliance report). The
necessity/proportionality judgement and the residual-risk sign-off are left to
the controller.

Like :mod:`maverick.ropa` and :mod:`maverick.soc2`, this is fail-soft and
import-light — it never raises. Surfaced as ``maverick dpia``.
