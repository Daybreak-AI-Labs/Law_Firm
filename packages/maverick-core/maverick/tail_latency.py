"""Tail-latency hunting (roadmap: 2027 H2 performance).

:mod:`maverick.tool_latency` already computes per-tool p50/p95/p99. The slowest
tool by p95 isn't necessarily the one to *hunt*, though — the interesting bug
is the tool that is usually fast but occasionally terrible (a fat tail): most
calls fine, a few pathological. This flags those by the **tail ratio**
(p99 ÷ p50): a high ratio means the tail is far worse than the typical case, so
that's where to look (a retry storm, a cold cache, a lock).

Pure over a latency report (the live one or one passed in), so it's tested with
synthetic numbers; surfaced via the dashboard ``/api/v1/diag/tail-latency``,
which runs in the long-lived serving process where the samples actually
accumulate.
