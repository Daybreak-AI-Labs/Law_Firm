"""Offline snapshot bundle for the mobile companion app.

``build_bundle(world)`` produces a compact, bounded, versioned snapshot the
mobile app caches locally (AsyncStorage) and renders when the dashboard is
unreachable — "as of N minutes ago" instead of a blank screen.

Design rules:
  - **Versioned**: ``schema = "maverick-offline/1"`` so clients can refuse
    shapes they don't understand.
  - **Deterministic field set**: exactly the keys in ``GOAL_FIELDS`` /
    ``EVENT_FIELDS``, nothing else, so the client renderer never guesses.
  - **Bounded everywhere**: goal count, event count, and string lengths are
    all capped; a year-old world produces the same-sized bundle as a fresh one.
  - **No secrets**: only world-DB rows (titles, statuses, event text) — never
    tokens, keys, or environment values. Enforced by test.

The serving endpoint (``GET /api/v1/offline/bundle``) lives in the dashboard
package; this module is dashboard-agnostic so it can be tested with a fake
world and reused by other read-only surfaces (watch, CLI ``--offline``).
