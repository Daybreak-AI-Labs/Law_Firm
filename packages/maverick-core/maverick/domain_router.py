"""Specialist routing: rank packs by relevance to a task.

This is the deterministic pre-filter for the retained legal roster: a
dependency-free lexical retriever (weighted TF-IDF over each pack's name,
description, and persona) that narrows the roster to a short list. The model
still makes the final selection.

Routing is deliberately lexical and process-local. The former semantic router
could initialize an optional model by repository id, download weights, and keep
a tenant-global embedding cache. Client-matter semantic recall now exists only
behind the pinned local knowledge embedder and an exact MatterContext.
