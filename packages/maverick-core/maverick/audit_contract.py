"""CI gate: an audit write must not be wrapped in a refusal-swallowing except.

The audit subsystem raises :class:`~maverick.audit.errors.AuditRefused` when it
*declines* to write -- a compliance floor mandates a signed chain and the signer
will not start, or custody policy forbids a co-located key. A caller that
catches it and continues converts "we could not record this action" into "we
recorded nothing and did it anyway", which is the exact failure the guarantee
exists to prevent.

That contract used to live in a docstring. A census found ~93 non-test
``record()`` call sites, 42 wrapped in a bare ``except Exception: pass``, and
exactly ONE that re-raised. A contract honoured at one site in ninety-three is
not a contract. This gate makes it structural.

**Preferred fix:** call :func:`maverick.audit.audit_event` instead of wrapping
``record()`` yourself. It applies the contract and logs other failures with a
traceback, so a permanently broken audit path stops looking like a healthy one.

**Otherwise:** re-raise the base class before the broad handler::

    try:
        record(...)
    except AuditRefused:
        raise
    except Exception:
        log.warning(..., exc_info=True)

Catching ``AuditWriteRefused`` alone is NOT sufficient and this gate says so:
its sibling ``OffHostSigningRequiredError`` fires under the strictest posture
the product sells, and the one hardened call site in the tree was hardened
against the wrong half of the pair.

CLI: ``python -m maverick.audit_contract --ci`` exits non-zero on any new
violation. Existing violations are ratcheted in ``audit_contract.baseline.json``
so the gate lands green and blocks regressions; the baseline is a debt register
to shrink, not a permanent exemption. ``--regen`` rewrites it.

Vacuous-gate protection: the gate exits non-zero if it inspects zero files, so a
broken path or a bad filter can never be mistaken for a pass.
