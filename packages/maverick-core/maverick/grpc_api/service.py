"""Transport-agnostic goal service backing the gRPC surface.

The gRPC server (``server.py``) is a thin protobuf shim over this class; all the
behaviour lives here so it is unit-tested without grpc installed and could back
a second transport (REST, a queue worker) unchanged.

Three operations, mirroring the roadmap's gRPC surface:
  - ``start_goal``   -> create a goal and dispatch it for background execution.
  - ``stream_episode`` -> yield the goal's events as they land, until terminal.
  - ``cancel``       -> mark a goal cancelled (honoured at the next dispatch /
    turn boundary; in-flight cooperative cancellation rides the global
    killswitch, which the agent loop already checks).

Dependencies (the world model + the dispatcher + a thread spawner) are injected
so tests drive the whole flow with in-memory fakes.
