"""Perceptual image hashing — 8x8 average-hash + Hamming distance.

Answers "are these two screenshots the same screen?" without a vision model:
two images whose hashes are a few bits apart are near-duplicates; far apart
means the screen changed. This is a classic *perceptual hash*, not a neural
classifier — it has no notion of objects or text, only coarse luminance
layout. That is exactly the honest scope: cheap, local, deterministic.

The algorithm is specified in **integer arithmetic only** so the JavaScript
twin (``extensions/webgpu-vision/ahash.js``) produces bit-identical hashes —
no float rounding can diverge across languages:

  1. gray(p)   = r*299 + g*587 + b*114                  (luma x1000, exact int)
  2. cells     = 8x8 grid; cell (cx, cy) covers x in [cx*w//8, (cx+1)*w//8)
                 and y likewise (requires w >= 8 and h >= 8)
  3. bit       = 1 iff cell_sum * total_count > total_sum * cell_count
                 (cross-multiplied average comparison; ties are 0)
  4. pack      = row-major (cy outer), MSB first; render as 16 hex chars

Both sides assert ``GRADIENT_HASH`` over the same synthetic gradient, proving
the implementations agree. Pillow is imported lazily and ONLY by
``average_hash_file`` (the ``computer-use`` extra); the pixel-level API and
``hamming`` are dependency-free.
