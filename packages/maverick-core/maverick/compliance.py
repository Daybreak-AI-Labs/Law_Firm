"""EU AI Act Article 50 transparency disclosure for channel users.

The EU AI Act becomes enforceable Aug 2 2026 — see May 2026 Commission
guidelines covering agentic AI as a single high-risk system. Article 50
mandates that users interacting with a chatbot must be informed they
are talking to AI unless that fact is obvious from context.

This module gives the channel server a single function:

    disclosure = first_turn_disclosure(channel, user_id)

It returns the disclosure string to PREPEND to the agent's first reply
on each new conversation, or None if the user has already seen it (we
track via the world model's conversations.last_seen vs created_at).
