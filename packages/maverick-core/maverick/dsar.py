"""Data-subject access request (DSAR) export — GDPR Art. 15 / 20.

The erase side of GDPR (``maverick.audit.erase`` + ``maverick erase``) already
covers Art. 17 right-to-erasure. This module is its read-only mirror: the
right of access / portability. :func:`export_subject_data` gathers everything
Maverick holds for one subject (a channel ``user_id``) into a single
JSON-serializable bundle a controller can hand back to the data subject.

It only ever *reads*. Every store is consulted defensively: a missing or empty
world DB / audit dir yields an empty section, never an exception — an export
must not be the thing that crashes on a half-provisioned install.

Two stores are covered:

  - the **world model** (conversations + turns, and the goals/episodes those
    turns reference), read via the existing :class:`maverick.world_model.WorldModel`
    read APIs and tenant-resolved through
    :func:`maverick.world_model.world_for_tenant`;
  - the **audit log** NDJSON, scoped to rows whose structured ``channel`` /
    ``user_id`` fields identify the subject — the same exact-field rule the
    erase path (:func:`maverick.audit.erase._event_matches`) uses, so export
    and erase agree on what "this subject's data" means.

Isolation is the load-bearing property: this is subject data, so the bundle
must contain the requested subject's rows and *only* those. Matching is on
exact ``user_id`` equality (optionally narrowed to a channel); we never
substring-match a serialized value, which would leak co-tenants whose ids
share a prefix.
