"""Backwards-compat tooling: ``maverick migrate`` (roadmap: 2027 H2 distribution).

Upgrades change what config means; this is the tool that walks an existing
``~/.maverick/config.toml`` forward. Three honest pieces:

* **Advisories** — real, currently-known migration paths (e.g. the Twilio
  WhatsApp adapter → the first-party Cloud API adapter). Advisories never
  rewrite config; they tell the operator what to change and why.
* **Config lint** — unknown top-level sections (typos: ``[budgets]`` for
  ``[budget]``) flagged against the known-section table, since a misspelled
  section silently no-ops and the operator thinks the knob is on.
* **Rewrites** — mechanical key renames, applied only with ``--apply`` and
  only after a timestamped backup of the config file. The rewrite table is
  empty today — no key has been renamed yet — but the machinery (backup,
  atomic write, stamp) is what a 2.0 rename lands on.

Dry-run is the default; nothing is written without ``--apply``, and nothing
is ever written without a backup.
