"""Shield policy — make the safety shield MANDATORY for regulated deployments.

By kernel rule 1 the shield is optional and fails OPEN: when ``maverick-shield``
isn't installed, external content is admitted unscreened. That's the right
default for a personal agent and the wrong one for a regulated client whose
security review will not accept a control that silently disappears if a
dependency is missing.

This module centralizes the "is the shield required, and what's the block
reason for this text" decision so every external-facing surface (federation
inbound, A2A) screens consistently and **fails toward the gate** when the shield
is required:

* ``shield_required()`` — on via ``MAVERICK_REQUIRE_SHIELD``, ``[safety]
  require_shield = true``, or enterprise mode.
* ``scan_block(text)`` — returns a block reason or ``None`` (allow). A shield
  *scan error* always blocks (fail-toward-gate). A *missing* shield blocks only
  when required (so non-enterprise installs keep the fail-open default).
