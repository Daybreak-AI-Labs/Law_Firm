"""Plain-language run explanations (roadmap 2027-H1 UX).

The trajectory page shows engineers raw events; a non-technical reviewer
needs the same story in sentences: what was asked, what the team planned,
what it found, what went wrong, how it ended. This renders that narrative
**deterministically from the recorded events** — template prose, no LLM call,
so the explanation is free, instant, and never hallucinates beyond the log.

Resilient by design: known event kinds (plan / finding / observation / error /
skill) get tailored phrasing; unknown kinds fall into a generic "worked on"
bucket rather than breaking the story.
