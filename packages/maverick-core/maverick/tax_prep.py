"""Tax preparation pipeline: uploaded documents -> first-pass draft return.

The flagship professional-services workflow. A client uploads source
documents; the ``tax_`` suite's agents classify and extract them; this
module is the DETERMINISTIC core they feed: typed source documents in,
standardized workpaper out, first-pass Form 1040 + state computation on
top, and a review package where **every number cites the document it came
from**.

Division of labor (the architecture's spine):

* **Agents** (tax_ packs) do the unstructured work at runtime -- chasing
  missing documents, OCR/extraction from PDFs, client communications --
  and feed structured :class:`SourceDoc` records into this module. The
  firm's professional tax engine (CCH Axcess / GoSystem, via the
  ``cch_axcess`` / ``gosystem_tax`` connectors) remains the authoritative
  computation and filing system; this first pass is the prep accelerant
  and cross-check in front of it.
* **This module** does everything that must be exactly right and provable:
  classification schemas, workpaper assembly, completeness checks, the
  TY2025 federal computation, the flat/no-tax state computation, and the
  review package. Pure functions, no LLM, unit-tested against
  hand-computed returns.
* **The CPA** reviews and signs. The draft is labeled as a first pass for
  preparer review; filing and certification are human acts (the same
  "agents draft; humans file and certify" discipline as the finance suite).

Scope of the v1 computation (stated, not hidden): Form 1040 with W-2 wages,
1099-INT interest, ordinary 1099-DIV dividends, the standard deduction, the
child tax credit, and federal withholding; plus state returns for no-tax
and flat-rate states (graduated states are flagged for the preparer / the
tax engine). Itemizing, Schedules C/D/E, retirement and benefit taxability,
and credits beyond the CTC are workpaper line items flagged FOR PREPARER
REVIEW rather than computed. Tax-year constants live in two tables
(``TY2025`` federal per the One Big Beautiful Bill Act; ``STATE_TY2025``)
and ship as content updates each season.
