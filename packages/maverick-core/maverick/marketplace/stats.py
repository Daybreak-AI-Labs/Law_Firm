"""Marketplace stats (roadmap: 2028 H2 ecosystem — "marketplace stats dashboard").

Aggregates the local ratings ledger (:mod:`maverick.marketplace_ratings`) into
the numbers a stats view wants: how many things you've rated, the average, the
1–5★ distribution, a per-kind breakdown (skills vs templates vs channels), and
your top-rated items. Self-host-first: this summarizes the operator's **own**
ledger (there is no hosted community service); the dashboard renders it and
``maverick template rate`` feeds it.

Pure and deterministic — a ledger in, a stats dict out — so it's tested without
disk or a server.
