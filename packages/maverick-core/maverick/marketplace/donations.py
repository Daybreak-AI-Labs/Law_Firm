"""Marketplace donate-direct — validated donation *links* on listings.

Skill authors may declare a ``donation_url`` in their raw listing JSON (the
catalog index entry). This module validates it against a strict allowlist and
surfaces it for display. Scope, stated plainly:

  - **Links only. No payment processing.** Lightwork never touches money,
    never proxies a checkout, never adds query parameters or referral codes.
    The validated URL is shown to the user; clicking it is between the user,
    their browser, and the platform.
  - ``donation_url`` is an *optional raw-listing field*. The typed
    :class:`maverick.catalog.CatalogEntry` deliberately does not model it
    (no catalog schema change); consumers read it from the raw listing dict
    via :func:`donation_info`. The federation import path
    (``marketplace_federation``) carries and re-validates it.
  - The moderation gauntlet (``maverick.tools.marketplace_moderation``) is a
    single pure ``_scan`` function with no pluggable checks list, so donation
    validation is NOT folded into it (restructuring it for one check isn't
    worth the churn). Composers run :func:`validate_donation_url` alongside
    the gauntlet — ``marketplace_federation.import_listings`` does exactly
    that, stripping invalid links.

Validation is fail-closed: https only, no userinfo, no explicit port, host
exactly on the allowlist (``www.`` tolerated), and ``github.com`` only under
``/sponsors/<name>``. Anything else is rejected.
