"""Skill-marketplace federation — signed listing bundles between instances.

``export_listings`` packs this instance's marketplace listings (the real
storage: :func:`maverick.catalog.load_catalog` entries — the merged, curated
catalog indexes this host trusts) into a versioned, Ed25519-signed envelope::

    {"schema": "maverick-marketplace-fed/1", "origin", "created_at",
     "listings": [...], "pubkey", "key_id", "sig"}

``import_listings`` applies a peer's envelope, **fail-closed**:

  1. signature verified against the *pinned* key for the envelope's origin
     (``[federation] marketplace_peers``); bad/missing signature, unknown
     origin, or a missing ``cryptography`` library all reject the whole
     envelope and persist nothing;
  2. every listing is re-run through the LOCAL moderation gauntlet
     (``maverick.tools.marketplace_moderation._scan`` — projected as
     ``{title: name, description: summary, tags: [kind]}``, the closest
     honest mapping of a catalog entry onto the gauntlet's fields); only
     APPROVE becomes visible, REVIEW/REJECT are recorded with reasons;
  3. a declared ``donation_url`` is re-validated
     (``marketplace_donations.validate_donation_url``); invalid links are
     stripped (the listing itself may still be fine — the link is the risk);
  4. accepted listings are namespaced ``"<origin>/<name>"``. Origins are
     restricted to ``[a-z0-9._-]`` (no ``/``), so an imported name can never
     equal a plain local listing name — imports cannot shadow local entries.

Imports persist to ``data_dir("marketplace_federation_imports.json")``
(atomic, 0600), where one import *replaces* that origin's previous set (a
re-sync, so renames/withdrawals propagate and the store stays bounded).
Browse/install surfaces opt in by merging :func:`imported_listings`; nothing
auto-installs.

**Ratings do NOT federate.** Local ratings (``marketplace_ratings``) are the
operator's own first-person stars; a peer's aggregates are self-asserted
numbers whose provenance this protocol cannot verify (no per-rater identity
or signature), so exports strip ``rating``/``ratings_count`` — along with
``verified`` and ``install_count``, which are equally self-asserted display
fields.
