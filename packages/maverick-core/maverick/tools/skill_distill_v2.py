"""Auto-skill distillation v2 (roadmap: 2027 H1 capabilities).

Turn a successful execution trace into a reusable skill spec. v1 naively
replayed every recorded action; v2 distills — it keeps only the steps that
actually succeeded (``ok``), drops no-op/noise actions, de-duplicates the tools
needed, and records ordered steps plus the goal as a trigger. The result is a
compact ``{name, triggers, tools_needed, steps}`` the planner can reuse.

ops:
  - distill(trace, goal)  — trace: [{action, tool, ok}] -> a skill spec.
