"""Capability negotiation protocol (roadmap: 2028 H1 — agent-to-agent capability negotiation).

A requester asks for a set of capabilities; an offerer publishes the set it is
willing to grant plus optional constraints (which requested items are
``required`` for the requester, and a ``deny`` list the offerer refuses outright).
This resolves the negotiation deterministically and offline: the granted
intersection, the denied items with reasons, and whether the negotiation
SUCCEEDS — which it does only when every required capability was granted.

ops:
  - negotiate(requested, allowed[, required][, deny])

A requested capability is GRANTED when it is in ``allowed`` and not in ``deny``.
It is DENIED with reason "explicitly denied" (in ``deny``) or "not offered"
(absent from ``allowed``).
