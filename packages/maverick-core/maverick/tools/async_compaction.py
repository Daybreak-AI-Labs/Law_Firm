"""Async compaction scheduler (roadmap: 2027 H1 — async history compaction).

Decide which history segments to compact *now* to fit a token budget without
blocking the agent loop. The caller supplies the segments and a budget; this
returns the compaction plan, projected token savings, and the order to compact
in. Deterministic and offline.

Rules:
  - The ``keep_recent`` newest segments are always KEPT (never compacted) — the
    working set the model needs verbatim.
  - Pinned segments are always KEPT regardless of age.
  - Of the remaining (older, unpinned) segments, compact oldest-first until the
    projected total fits ``max_tokens``; the rest are DEFERred for a later pass.
  - Compaction is assumed to shrink a segment to ~``compact_ratio`` of its
    tokens (default 0.2); savings = tokens * (1 - ratio).

ops:
  - plan(segments, budget)  — KEEP/COMPACT/DEFER, savings, compaction order.

Segments: ``[{"tokens", "age_turns", "pinned"?}]`` (age_turns: higher = older).
Budget:   ``{"max_tokens", "keep_recent", "compact_ratio"?}``.
