"""Tool: link this run to an external business key for later grounding.

When a run acts on a real-world entity -- creates invoice ``INV-42``, opens
ticket ``SUP-91`` -- it can record that key here so that weeks later, when the
system of record reports the *actual* outcome (invoice paid, ticket reopened) to
``/outcomes/by-key``, Lightwork can join it back to the episode that acted and
learn from reality instead of a proxy. This is the run-side half of the
Consequence Engine's grounded loop.

Gated on ``[consequence]`` -- registered only when the operator has turned the
learning loop on, so the default tool surface is unchanged (kernel rule 1).
