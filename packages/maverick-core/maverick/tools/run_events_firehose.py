"""Run-events firehose serializer (roadmap: 2027 H2 — "run-events firehose
(WebSocket)").

Encode and filter the stream of run events that a WebSocket firehose would push
to dashboards. Pure and offline: this is the *serializer*, not the socket — it
turns an event dict into one JSON line (NDJSON) with a caller-supplied monotonic
sequence number, and filters a batch of events by type / goal. No I/O.

ops:
  - encode(event={type, goal_id, ts, data}, seq) -> a single JSON line for the
    WS firehose, stamped with ``seq``. Validates ``type`` against the known set.
  - filter(events, types?, goal_id?) -> the matching subset (JSON array).

Known event types are validated so a typo'd producer can't poison the stream.
