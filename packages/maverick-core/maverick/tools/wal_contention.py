"""WAL contention audit (roadmap: 2027 H1 — "WAL contention audit N=16").

A write-ahead log serialises commits, so p99 write latency should rise roughly
linearly with the number of concurrent writers. Where it rises *superlinearly*,
the WAL is the bottleneck and adding writers only hurts. Given p50/p99 latency
samples grouped by writer count, this flags the superlinear knees and recommends
a max-writers ceiling. Deterministic and offline.

Method: sort the buckets by writer count. Linear scaling predicts
``p99 ~ p99(baseline) * writers / writers(baseline)`` using the lowest writer
count as the baseline. A bucket is SUPERLINEAR when its observed p99 exceeds the
linear prediction by more than ``tolerance`` (default 25%). The recommended
ceiling is the largest writer count still scaling within tolerance (the last
good bucket before the first knee).

ops:
  - analyze(buckets, [tolerance])  — per-bucket OK/SUPERLINEAR + max-writers.

Buckets: ``[{"writers", "p50_ms", "p99_ms"}]``.
