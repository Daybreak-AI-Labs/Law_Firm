"""Right-to-rectification applier (roadmap: 2027 safety — "right-to-rectification").

GDPR Art. 16 lets a data subject have inaccurate personal data corrected and
incomplete data completed. ``audit/erase.py`` already covers Art. 17 erasure;
this is the rectification counterpart: validate a set of requested field changes
against a mutability policy and produce the corrected record plus an auditable
diff. Immutable fields (ids, keys) are rejected, no-op changes are dropped, and
adding brand-new fields is gated. Pure dict work — deterministic and offline.

ops:
  - apply(record, changes, [immutable], [allow_new])  — ``record`` and
    ``changes`` are objects. Reports APPLIED / PARTIAL / REJECTED, the accepted
    changes (field: old -> new), any rejected ones with a reason, and the
    corrected record as JSON. ``immutable`` is a list of un-rectifiable fields;
    ``allow_new`` (default false) permits completing fields absent from
    ``record``.
