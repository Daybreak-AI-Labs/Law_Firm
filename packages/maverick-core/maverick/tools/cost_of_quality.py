"""Cost-of-quality study helper (roadmap: 2028 H1 — "cost of quality").

Quantify how much of a run budget went to *successful* work versus retries and
failed attempts — the "cost of poor quality" view. Deterministic and offline:
given per-run cost and a pass/fail flag, this splits total spend into passing vs
failing, derives the cost per successful run, and the wasted-spend ratio (the
share of dollars that did not end in a success).

ops:
  - analyze(runs)  — runs: [{cost, passed(bool), retries?}].
