"""Operational risk-tier scorer for agent goals (roadmap: 2028 safety —
"risk-tier auto-classifier (low/med/high goal scoring)").

Scores a goal/task into LOW / MEDIUM / HIGH from explicit operational risk
signals (shell, network, secrets, PII, spend, irreversibility, production,
external send) so the agent loop can gate the risky ones — extra approval,
containment, or a budget cap. This is operational triage, distinct from
``ai_act_classifier`` (EU AI Act regulatory tiers). Transparent additive
scoring — deterministic and offline.

ops:
  - score(signals, [spend_usd])  — TIER + numeric score + the contributing
    factors. ``signals`` is ``{name: bool}`` over the known risk signals;
    ``spend_usd`` adds weight by magnitude.
