"""The ``learn_capability`` tool: close a capability gap mid-run.

Bound to the calling agent (like the spawn tools) so it can mutate the
LIVE tool registry — a capability acquired here is in the tool catalog
the model sees on its NEXT turn, no restart required.

Ops:
  - search          : find existing skills / MCP servers / plugins in the
                      catalog that match a need, plus already-loaded tools.
  - acquire_skill   : install a catalog skill by name (hash-verified) and
                      return its steps so they're usable immediately.
  - add_mcp_server  : add an MCP server BY CATALOG NAME (command + sha
                      come from the curated, hash-pinned catalog entry —
                      never a model-supplied command), gated behind an
                      explicit opt-in AND operator consent. Off by default.
  - create_tool     : GENERATE a Python tool from a spec, validate it, and
                      register it live (full-autonomy; gated by settings).
  - find_api        : discover an API's OpenAPI spec (probe a base_url or
                      web-search) and surface its operations, ready to drive
                      via the built-in ``openapi_runner`` tool.

Gated entirely by ``self_learning.enabled()``; the kernel never registers
this tool otherwise.
