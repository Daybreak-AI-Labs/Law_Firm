"""Capability revocation propagation (roadmap: 2028 H2 safety).

When a capability is revoked from a principal, every principal that holds that
capability *only* by transitive delegation from the revoked holder must lose it
too. Given a delegation graph (grants: principal -> grantee : capability) and a
revocation (principal, capability), compute the full set of principals that
transitively lose the capability via BFS over the grant edges for that
capability. Deterministic and offline.

ops:
  - propagate(grants, principal, capability)  — grants: [{from,to,capability}].
