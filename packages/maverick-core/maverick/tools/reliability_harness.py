"""Reliability harness (roadmap: 2028 H2 "reliability harness 2.0").

Summarise repeated test runs into a per-test reliability report and an overall
reliability score. Deterministic and offline: the caller supplies the test runs
(each ``{name, outcomes: [bool, ...]}`` where each bool is one pass/fail); this
resolves the classification.

Per-test classification over its outcomes:
  - STABLE-PASS: every run passed.
  - ALWAYS-FAIL: every run failed.
  - FLAKY: mixed pass and fail.

Overall reliability % is the total passes across every outcome of every test
divided by the total number of outcomes.

ops:
  - report(runs)  — per-test pass-rate + status + overall reliability %.
