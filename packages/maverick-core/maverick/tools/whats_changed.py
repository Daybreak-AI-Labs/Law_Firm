"""\"What changed\" digest tool (roadmap: 2027 H1 UX — "what changed" digest).

Turn a before/after snapshot into the human-readable summary a reviewer wants:
which keys were added, removed, or changed (with old->new values), or — for two
blobs of text — a one-line tally of the unified diff. Deterministic and offline:
dict diffing is pure set/compare logic; text diffing uses ``difflib``.

ops:
  - diff(before, after)            — key-level digest of two flat objects.
  - diff_text(before_str, after_str) — unified-diff summary (+/- line counts).
