"""Goal risk-tier auto-classifier (roadmap: 2028 H1 safety).

Score a proposed goal/action as LOW / MEDIUM / HIGH risk from a small set of
boolean *signals* about what it does — is it irreversible, does it move money,
does it touch PII, does it egress over the network, does it have a wide blast
radius? Distinct from ``ai_act_classifier`` (which screens EU AI Act tiers from
a free-text description): this is a general, weighted, signal-driven scorer for
gating how much oversight a step needs. Deterministic weighted sum with
documented weights and thresholds.

ops:
  - score(signals)  — LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH + contributing factors + numeric score.

Signals (all optional booleans; missing = absent):
  irreversible?, moves_money?, touches_pii?, network_egress?, affects_many?
A numeric ``custom_weight`` may be added on top of the matched factor weights.

Weights (points) and thresholds are fixed so the same signals always map to the
same tier: HIGH at >= 6, MEDIUM at >= 3, else LOW.
