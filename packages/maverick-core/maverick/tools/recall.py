"""Cross-goal memory recall tool.

Lets the agent ask "have we solved something like this before?" against
the world_model's history. Returns past goals ranked by similarity to
the query text, with their status and final result snippet.

Two scoring backends, chosen automatically:
  1. fastembed (when available)   -> dense cosine similarity
  2. token-Jaccard fallback        -> works without any extra deps

This is the simplest cross-run memory primitive: no continuous-learning
loop, no embedding daemon, no separate vector store. Past goals already
live in the world_model SQLite; we re-rank them on demand and return
the top K. Slow on huge histories (linear scan), but those installs
already have skill_embeddings to cache; we re-use the same model.
