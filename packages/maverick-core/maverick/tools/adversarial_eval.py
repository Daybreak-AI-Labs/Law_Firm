"""Adversarial eval harness — scorer (roadmap: 2027 H1 safety).

The red-team corpus produces, for each adversarial prompt, an *expected*
verdict (the shield should block it) and the shield's *actual* verdict. This
tool scores that batch: a confusion matrix with "block" as the positive class,
the safety-relevant rates (recall = caught attacks, false-positive rate =
over-blocking), and — most important — the list of MISSED attacks (expected
block, got allow), which is what a red-team CI run gates on.

Deterministic and offline; it grades verdicts, it does not call the shield.

ops:
  - score(cases)  — cases: [{prompt, expected, actual}] where expected/actual
    are "block" or "allow" (synonyms accepted: deny/refuse, pass/permit).
    Reports the matrix, recall/precision/pass-rate, and missed attacks.
