"""Right-to-explanation for governance decisions (roadmap: 2028 H1 safety).

GDPR Art. 22 / EU AI Act Art. 14: a person subject to an automated decision is
owed a *meaningful explanation*. Maverick's governance engine
(:func:`maverick.governance.evaluate`) already records which clause fired and
why; this tool turns that into the human-facing explanation — the decision,
the rule that produced it, the plain-language reason, and the **counterfactual**
("it would have been ALLOWED if ..."), which is the part an affected person
actually needs.

Distinct from the ``decision_explainer`` tool (which breaks down an additive
*scorecard*): this explains the deterministic policy decisions Maverick itself
makes about whether an action may run. Deterministic, offline — it re-runs the
real evaluator over the supplied policy/action/context.

ops:
  - explain(action[, risk, amount, currency, policy])  — policy is the
    governance Policy as a config-shaped dict (deny_actions,
    require_human_actions, deny_min_risk, require_human_min_risk, deny_above,
    require_human_above). Reports decision + rule + reason + counterfactual.
