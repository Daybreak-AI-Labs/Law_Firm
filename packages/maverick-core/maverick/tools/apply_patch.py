"""Multi-file atomic apply_patch tool.

Apply a unified diff via ``git apply``. Either every hunk applies
cleanly OR the entire patch is rejected and the workspace is
untouched. No half-applied state.

``git apply --check`` validates first; on success, ``git apply``
writes. On any failure we report the stderr without writing.

Works inside any directory that has a ``.git`` (or is a git
worktree). Falls back to an actionable error otherwise — without a
git index there's no reliable way to apply a unified diff atomically.
