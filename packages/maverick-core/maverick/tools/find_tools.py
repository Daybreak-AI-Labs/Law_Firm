"""find_tools: the deferred-tool discovery meta-tool.

With deferred loading on (``ToolRegistry.enable_deferred``), the model only
sees a small core set + this tool. Calling ``find_tools(query)`` ranks the
hidden long-tail tools by relevance, ACTIVATES the best matches (so they
appear in the catalog on the next turn and become callable), and returns
their names + descriptions so the model knows what it just unlocked.

Ranking is lexical (token overlap of the query against each tool's name +
description, with a name-match bias) -- no embedding dependency, so it runs
in the kernel with zero extra installs.
