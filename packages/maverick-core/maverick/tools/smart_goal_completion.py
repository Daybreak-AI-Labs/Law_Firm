"""Smart goal completion (roadmap: 2028 H1 UX).

Given a partial goal the user is typing and a history of past goals, suggest the
most likely completions. Pure lexical ranking — no LLM, no embeddings: a past
goal scores on (1) whether it starts with the partial (prefix bonus) and (2)
how many of the partial's tokens appear in it (token overlap). Deterministic and
offline: the same inputs always yield the same ordering (ties broken by recency
then alphabetically).

ops:
  - suggest(partial, history[, k])  — top-k past goals as completions.

``history`` is a list of past goal strings, most-recent-last (so later entries
win ties). Empty/blank partials return the most recent unique goals.
