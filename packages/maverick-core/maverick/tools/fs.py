"""Filesystem tools backed by the sandbox.

v0.1.1 fix: ``read_file`` / ``list_dir`` no longer interpolate the
LLM-supplied path into a shell command. They use ``pathlib`` directly
and verify the resolved path stays inside the sandbox workdir.

``write_file`` already used pathlib; tightened the path-traversal
check to match.

The shell tool (`shell.py`) intentionally exposes shell execution —
that's its purpose. Shield's `scan_tool_call` chokepoint guards it.
