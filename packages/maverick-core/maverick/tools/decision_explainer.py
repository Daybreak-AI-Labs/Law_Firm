"""Additive-decision explainer (roadmap: 2028 safety — "right-to-explanation").

For an automated decision driven by a linear scorecard (score = sum of
weight x value, plus an intercept), this produces the per-factor contribution
breakdown a data subject is owed under GDPR Art. 22 / "right to explanation":
which factors pushed the decision which way, and by how much. Given a decision
threshold it also reports the outcome and the margin to that threshold. Pure
arithmetic — deterministic and offline; only explains additive models.
(It does not yet compute counterfactual recourse — the minimal factor change
that would flip the outcome.)

ops:
  - explain(factors, [intercept], [threshold])  — ``factors`` is
    ``{name: {weight, value}}``. Reports the total score, each factor's signed
    contribution (ranked by magnitude), and — when ``threshold`` is given — the
    APPROVED/DENIED outcome and the margin to the threshold.
