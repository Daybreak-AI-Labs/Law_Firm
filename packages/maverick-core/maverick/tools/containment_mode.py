"""Containment-mode resolver (roadmap: 2028 H1 safety — "no-network ephemeral fs").

Turn a coarse containment *level* into the concrete restrictions an executor
should apply, and answer whether a specific action is permitted at that level.
Pure policy — no side effects, no shell. Three levels, increasingly locked down:

  - off     — no extra restrictions (everything allowed).
  - network — deny network egress; the filesystem is left as-is.
  - full    — "no-network ephemeral fs": deny network, ephemeral filesystem,
              run in a throwaway tmp workdir, and withhold credentials.

ops:
  - plan(level)            — structured list of restrictions for that level.
  - check(action, level)   — ALLOW/DENY for one action at that level.

Known actions: http_fetch, dns_lookup, send_email (network);
write_file, persist_state (filesystem persistence); read_secret, use_credential
(credentials); read_file, compute (always-local). Unknown actions fail-OPEN
(ALLOW) at off/network — those levels make only a targeted promise — but
fail-CLOSED (DENY) at full: the maximal containment level is a comprehensive
lockdown, so anything it can't classify is denied by default.
