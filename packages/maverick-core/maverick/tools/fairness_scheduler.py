"""Multi-agent fairness scheduler tool (roadmap: 2028 H2 — "fairness scheduler").

Allocates a fixed number of execution slots across competing agents by weighted
fair share, using the largest-remainder (Hamilton) method, and never hands an
agent more slots than it has pending (queued) tasks. Slots freed by that cap are
redistributed to other still-wanting agents. Deterministic and offline.

ops:
  - schedule(agents, slots)  — returns the per-agent allocation map and totals.

``agents``: list of {id, weight?, pending}. ``weight`` defaults to 1.

    Re-apportioned in rounds: the Hamilton method distributes the still-free

    A cap hit in one round frees nothing in that round but removes the agent
    from the next round's pool, so the leftover flows to other wanting agents.
    Each round strictly increases the placed total or exhausts headroom, so the
