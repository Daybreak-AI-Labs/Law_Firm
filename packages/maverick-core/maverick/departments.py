"""Department bundles: the specialist packs as deployable teams.

One specialist pack is a single hire; a *department* is the whole team. This
module groups the built-in specialist packs (:mod:`maverick.domain`) by their
business *suite* into named, deployable units — "Finance", "Sales & GTM" — each
with a human-readable charter and a roster. It is the buyable-team layer the
dashboard and installer present on top of the 1,000+ packs: pick a department,
deploy its roster, and a fleet of specialists comes up together.

Read-only over the pack registry — assembling a department never mutates a pack.
Suites turned off in ``[suites]`` config drop out (via
:func:`maverick.domain.enabled_domains`), so a department reflects what the
operator has actually enabled, not the full catalog.
