"""Structured consequence previews for governed system-of-record writes.

:mod:`maverick.governed_rest` can already route a live Salesforce/ServiceNow
write through simulate -> approve -> commit -> lineage, but its
``preview_write`` returns a *sentence* ("would PATCH salesforce/... with fields
['Amount']"). Earned Autonomy (:mod:`maverick.earned_autonomy`) needs more than
a sentence to do its job: :class:`~maverick.earned_autonomy.ConsequencePreview`
wants the dollars at risk, the entities touched, and -- above all -- whether
the action is *reversible*, while
:func:`~maverick.earned_autonomy.shadow_execute` wants
:class:`~maverick.earned_autonomy.SagaStep` pairs carrying a real ``undo``.

This module is the adapter between the two. :func:`plan_write` turns one
connector write into a :class:`WritePlan`: a populated ``ConsequencePreview``
plus the saga steps that can execute and compensate it.

**Reversibility is earned here, never asserted.** The single rule this module
exists to enforce: an action is reversible only when we are *holding the thing
that inverts it* -- prior field values read back from the record, or a created
record's id captured from the create response. Anything else (a full-replace
PUT whose prior contains non-writable system fields, a DELETE that would come
back with a new id and dangling references, a record we could not read) is
reported ``reversible=False`` with ``undo=None``, which makes
:func:`~maverick.earned_autonomy.run_saga` refuse *before any effect* and
routes the action to a human. A failed restore-read demotes the plan; it never
degrades into an optimistic guess.

Two contract seams this module deliberately bridges:

* ``preview_write`` keeps its no-network guarantee (a REST write cannot be
  dry-run server-side, so the simulate path must not touch the API). Capturing
  a restore point *requires* reading prior state, so that read lives here, in
  the separate :func:`plan_write` seam, is GET-only, and is gated by
  ``[governed_connectors] restore_points``. ``plan_write`` still calls
  ``preview_write`` first, so op/path validation and the human sentence stay in
  exactly one place.
* :class:`RestConnector` reports upstream failure by *returning* a string that
  starts with ``ERROR:``; ``run_saga`` only compensates when a step *raises*.
  An unwrapped step would therefore book a failed write as a success and never
  roll back. :func:`_checked` converts one into the other -- see
  :class:`PlanError`.

Per-service knowledge (how a path names a record, which fields carry money,
where a create response hides the new id) lives in a :class:`RestDialect`;
:class:`SalesforceDialect` and :class:`ServiceNowDialect` ship, and an unknown
connector falls back to a conservative generic dialect that reads no record and
earns no reversibility.

Additive per kernel rule 1: nothing calls this unless an operator has enabled
governed connectors and Earned Autonomy.
