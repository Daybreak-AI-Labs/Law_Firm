"""GDPR Article 30 — Records of Processing Activities (ROPA) generator.

Article 30 requires a data controller to maintain a record of its processing
activities. Maverick already *knows* the technical half of that record from its
own schema and configuration: what categories of personal data it stores,
whether that data can leave the deployment boundary (the egress lock), how long
it is kept (retention), and which Art. 32 security measures are active (read
straight from the compliance report). This module assembles those into a
pre-filled Art. 30 record and leaves the organizational fields a controller must
own — identity, DPO, lawful basis, specific purposes — as explicit placeholders.

It is a *scaffold*, not a completed record: the same control-coverage-not-legal-
attestation line as ``maverick compliance``. Fail-soft and import-light like
:mod:`maverick.soc2` — it never raises, so it can be run against any deployment.

Surfaced as ``maverick ropa``.
