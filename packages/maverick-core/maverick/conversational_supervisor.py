"""Conversational supervisor — natural-language supervision of running work.

Parse short operator utterances ("what's running?", "how much have we spent
today?", "pause goal five", "what failed?", "prioritize the deploy goal") into
intents via a deterministic grammar (the same ``{slot}`` template compiler the
``voice_command_grammar`` tool uses — no model call on the hot path), answer
read intents from the world model + usage ledger, and route mutating intents
through a strict confirm gate.

Honesty notes (read before extending):

* **Pause / resume / priority are not first-class world-model concepts.**
  The goals table has ``status`` (pending/active/blocked/done/cancelled) and
  no priority column. Pause is therefore implemented as
  ``set_goal_status(id, "blocked")`` plus a supervision ``goal_event``; resume
  flips a blocked goal back to ``"pending"``; prioritize records a
  ``goal:<id>:priority`` fact via ``upsert_fact`` plus a supervision event.
  All of those are real, existing ``WorldModel`` methods — nothing here calls
  into machinery that does not exist.
* **"Failed" means status ``blocked``** — that is the vocabulary the
  orchestrator actually writes for a run that stopped without finishing.
* **The optional LLM seam never mutates.** When the grammar misses, an
  injected ``llm(utterance) -> str`` callable may map a paraphrase to one of
  the canonical phrases; the suggestion is re-parsed through the SAME grammar.
  A suggestion that parses to a *read* intent is answered (labelled as
  interpreted); a suggestion that parses to a *mutating* intent is never
  executed — the supervisor replies with the canonical phrase to say
  explicitly. An LLM failure or unparseable suggestion yields the honest
  "didn't understand, try: ..." help, never a guess.
* **Mutations fail closed.** Every mutating intent calls the injected
  ``confirm(description)`` seam and only a literal ``True`` (the shared
  ``tools.as_bool`` gate) authorises the change. No confirm seam => refusal.
