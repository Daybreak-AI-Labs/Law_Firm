"""``maverick connectors`` -- inspect + preview governed system-of-record writes.

Makes the governed-connector write path operable from the CLI: list the
connectors an operator has registered (``[governed_connectors]``) and SIMULATE a
write to preview its effect + approval requirement WITHOUT committing. Commit is
deliberately not exposed here -- a live system-of-record write needs an approver
and runs through the orchestrator's governed path, not a fire-and-forget CLI.

Registered by import at the end of the package __init__, like the other
``_*_groups`` modules.
