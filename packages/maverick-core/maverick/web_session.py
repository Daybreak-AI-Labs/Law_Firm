"""Stdlib-only signed session cookies for the dashboard's browser login.

The built-in OIDC browser-login flow (``maverick.oidc.login_enabled``) needs a
way to remember "this browser already completed SSO" across requests. The usual
answer is a signed cookie, but Starlette's ``SessionMiddleware`` /
``itsdangerous`` are NOT in Maverick's dependency graph and adding them would
violate the "no new top-level dependencies" rule. So we sign the cookie
ourselves with the standard library only (``hmac``/``hashlib``/``secrets``/
``base64``/``json``/``time``).

Format (a deliberately tiny, JWT-shaped two-segment token)::

    b64url(json(payload)) "." b64url(hmac_sha256(secret, json_bytes))

The payload is opaque JSON carrying at least ``{"sub": str, "exp": int}``. The
signature covers the *exact* JSON bytes that were encoded, so an attacker can't
re-serialize the payload differently and keep the MAC valid.

Security properties (load-bearing — this is the only thing standing between a
forged cookie and an authenticated session):

- The MAC is HMAC-SHA256 over the encoded payload bytes, keyed by the
  deployment's ``session_secret``. Without the secret a payload can't be signed.
- Verification recomputes the MAC and compares with :func:`hmac.compare_digest`
  (constant-time) to avoid a timing side-channel on the signature.
- Expiry is enforced: a structurally-valid, correctly-signed cookie whose
  ``exp`` is in the past is rejected.
- :func:`verify_session` NEVER raises on malformed input — any garbage (wrong
  shape, bad base64, non-JSON, missing fields, wrong secret, expired) returns
  ``None``. Callers treat ``None`` as "not authenticated" and fall through.

This module touches no network, no config, and no FastAPI — it's pure functions
over ``str``/``dict`` so it can be exhaustively unit-tested in isolation.
