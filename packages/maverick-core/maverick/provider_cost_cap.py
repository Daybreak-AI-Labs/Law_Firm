"""Provider-level cost caps across all runs (roadmap: 2028 H1 safety).

:class:`maverick.budget.Budget` caps **one run**; :mod:`maverick.quotas` caps
a **principal** per day. Neither bounds what the deployment as a whole may
spend at a given *provider* — fifty perfectly-budgeted runs are still a
$250 Anthropic day nobody approved. This module is the third axis: a ceiling
per provider per UTC period (day or month), enforced at the LLM dispatch
path via :func:`enforce`.

Config (opt-in; nothing configured = no caps = behavior unchanged)::

    [budget]
    provider_caps_period = "day"        # "day" (default) | "month"

    [budget.provider_caps]
    anthropic = 50.0                    # dollars per period
    openai    = 20.0

``MAVERICK_PROVIDER_CAPS_PERIOD`` overrides the period knob (env wins, the
house convention). Config readers are fail-soft: an unreadable config means
no caps, never a crash.

The ledger (``data_dir("provider_spend.json")``) maps
``{period_key: {provider: dollars}}`` — period keys are ``YYYY-MM-DD`` (day)
or ``YYYY-MM`` (month), always UTC so the window doesn't shift with host
timezone/DST. Writes are atomic (unique temp file + ``os.replace``, 0600)
and the whole read-modify-write is serialized by an in-process lock **plus a
cross-process advisory flock** on a ``.lock`` sidecar, mirroring
:mod:`maverick.quotas`; the ledger reloads per call rather than caching, so
concurrent processes don't clobber each other's totals (without the flock two
processes both load the same total, both add, and the second ``os.replace``
wins -- dollars vanish from a *spend-cap* ledger and the deployment overspends
past the configured ceiling). Recording is fail-soft (accounting must not
take down the agent loop) — but :func:`enforce` itself is the cap, and a cap
that is configured and exceeded *raises*.

Clock is injectable everywhere (``now=`` epoch seconds) so rollover tests
are deterministic. Stdlib-only, pure library, nothing imports it by default.
