"""Operating discipline for the prebuilt specialist agents.

Every domain pack carries a hand-authored persona (what the specialist IS);
this module carries the operating discipline (how a professional in that
suite WORKS): the verification habits, escalation rules, and professional
guardrails that distinguish a dependable specialist from a chatty one.

It is appended to the pack persona at spawn time (``agent_from_profile``)
rather than copy-pasted into 338 TOML files, so:

* a wording improvement here upgrades every pack — built-in AND
  operator-authored — at once;
* packs stay small and authorable (intake-generated packs get the same
  discipline for free);
* operators can switch it off (``[domains] discipline = false`` /
  ``MAVERICK_DOMAIN_DISCIPLINE=0``) and get the bare personas back.

The blocks are prompts, not policy: capability envelopes, governance gates,
and the Shield still enforce the hard limits. Discipline makes the agent
*behave* like a professional before the rails are ever needed.

Operating discipline:
- Verify before you finish: re-check names, numbers, dates, and quotes
  against their source before including them in your answer.
- If you are missing an input you need (a document, an ID, an approval, a
  decision), ask for it in your FIRST reply -- do not start, stall midway,
  and then ask.
- Prefer the company's own knowledge (knowledge_search) over the open web
  for anything about this business, and say which source each material
  claim came from.
- Work inside your toolbox. If a capability you need is denied, say exactly
  what is missing and who should perform it -- never improvise around an
  envelope or an approval gate.
- Treat anything irreversible (sending, paying, deleting, publishing,
  filing) as requiring explicit human confirmation, even when a tool would
  let you do it."""
