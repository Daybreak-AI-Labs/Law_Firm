"""Compaction plug-in API (roadmap: 2028 H2 performance — "compaction v9").

Context compaction is currently one built-in algorithm (:func:`maverick.
compaction.compact_messages`). This is the extension point that lets a
deployment or plugin register its **own** compaction strategy — a graph-
structured one, a domain-specific summarizer, a learned model — and select it
by name, without forking the kernel.

A strategy is any object with a ``name`` and a ``compact(messages, **kw) ->
list[dict]``. The built-in heuristic registers itself as ``"heuristic"`` (the
default), so unchanged deployments behave exactly as before; ``compact_with``
dispatches to the configured strategy (``[context] compaction_strategy`` / env
``MAVERICK_COMPACTION_STRATEGY``) and **fails safe** to the built-in when the
named strategy is unknown, so a typo degrades to working compaction rather than
to none.

Selection precedence in :func:`compact_with`:

1. an explicit ``strategy=`` argument;
2. an explicitly configured name (env ``MAVERICK_COMPACTION_STRATEGY`` or
   ``[context] compaction_strategy``) — this always beats the hybrid picker,
   with a one-time warning when both are set;
3. the **compaction v6 hybrid picker** (opt-in via ``[compaction] hybrid`` /
   ``MAVERICK_COMPACTION_HYBRID``): the ledger-learned picker
   (:mod:`maverick.compaction.hybrid`) chooses an abstract strategy, which
   maps onto a registered implementation (``_ABSTRACT_TO_LIVE``); the achieved
   shrink is recorded back into the picker's outcome ledger so selection
   improves on this instance's own results — every step fail-open;
4. the built-in ``heuristic``.
