"""Trace pinning to commit (roadmap: 2027 H2 UX).

A replayed trace is only meaningful against the code it ran on. This stamps
each run with the workspace's git state — commit, branch, and whether the
tree was dirty — as a ``trace_meta`` event at run start, so a trace, its
annotations, and a replay all tie back to an exact commit ("this run was
HEAD=abc123, dirty"). Reading it back is one helper.

Best-effort by design: a workspace that isn't a git repo (or has no git)
stamps nothing and the run proceeds — provenance must never block execution.
The git calls are argv-list subprocess with the secret-scrubbed env (no
shell), per the tools/host-exec doctrine.
