"""Governed self-improvement: the promotion ladder that makes learning *safe*.

Maverick already *learns* in several places (skills, reflexions, dreams,
config evolution). What it lacks is a single governed gate that decides whether
a proposed self-change is allowed to take effect -- and that is the whole moat.
A frontier lab can train a better policy; what it will not ship into a bank is a
system that rewrites *itself* in production. The defensible asset is not the
learning, it is the **interlocks that make self-modification deployable**: a
change may take effect only if it (a) measurably beats its own baseline, (b)
never widens the capability envelope, (c) is approved by a human at the rungs
that touch tools/code/weights, (d) is reversible, and (e) is refused outright
while the verifier is mis-calibrated (so the system can't learn from its own
drift). Every promotion is signed into the audit chain.

This module is that controller. It does NOT train models -- the per-rung work
(RL on trajectories, tool synthesis, code self-mod, fine-tuning) is injected as
opaque candidate payloads. It owns the *governance spine* shared by every rung,
so each new self-improvement capability inherits the same provable safety
properties instead of re-litigating them.

Rungs, lowest -> highest risk: ``config`` -> ``prompt`` -> ``tool`` ->
``policy`` -> ``code`` -> ``weights``. Higher rungs require capability evidence
and human approval; the lowest may auto-promote once they beat their baseline.

Posture: ON by default for governed prompt/policy learning, with an explicit
opt-out. The gates fail **closed**: a promotion is a privileged write, so a
broken gate, missing evidence, or any error rejects the change rather than
letting it through. Code/weight authority and DGM execution remain separately
gated. The engine being off is a no-op; the engine deciding will not promote on
doubt.
