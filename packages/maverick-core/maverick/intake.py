"""Intake -- the agent factory's front door.

Turns "what the business does" + its uploaded documents into a live, sealed,
knowledge-loaded domain agent:

    IntakeSpec --generate(LLM)--> DomainProfile --validate/clamp--> human approve
        --> save to ~/.maverick/domains/ --> agent_from_profile

The pack is LLM-generated (persona *and* capability envelope) from the business
description, but ALWAYS passed through ``validate_profile`` first -- a freshly
generated pack can never auto-grant high-impact tools or escalate risk. A human
widens the envelope at approval. This is the compartment "door" philosophy
applied to onboarding: an unvetted, model-authored agent starts locked down.

This module is the generation + safety core. The conversational intake agent
(interview + document/diagram collection) and the ``maverick onboard`` UX build
on top of it, supplying the ``propose`` callable and the human-approval step.
