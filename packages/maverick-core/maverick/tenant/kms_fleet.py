"""Operable, resumable fleet KEK rotation.

``kms.rotate_kek_fleet`` is the library primitive; this is the operations layer
behind ``maverick tenant kms-rotate``. It rotates every provisioned tenant's
wrapped DEK from one local KEK to another (the common fleet event: the at-rest
master key / ``MAVERICK_KMS_KEK`` is being rolled), with the properties a
fleet-scale operation needs:

* **Idempotent / resumable.** A tenant whose DEK already unwraps under the new
  KEK is skipped, so a rotation interrupted partway (signal, throttle, crash)
  finishes the rest on a plain re-run -- the on-disk wrapped DEK *is* the
  progress state; no separate manifest to drift.
* **Isolated failures.** One tenant's failure is recorded and never aborts the
  fleet; the report's ``failed`` map is the "do NOT retire the old KEK yet"
  signal.
* **Dry-run.** Probe what each tenant *would* do (rotate / skip / fail) without
  writing, so an operator can preview before committing.

Re-wrap only: no tenant data is re-encrypted (the DEK is unchanged), so the
operation is O(tenants), not O(data).

Cloud/BYOK rotation (each tenant under its own AWS/GCP/Vault key) uses the
library ``kms.rotate_kek_fleet`` with custom per-tenant resolvers instead.
