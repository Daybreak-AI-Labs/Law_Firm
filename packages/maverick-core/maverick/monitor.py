"""Live plan/activity monitor for Lightwork agents.

Reads the world model and renders a real-time view of:
  - the active goal (title, status, parent chain)
  - sub-goals (the plan tree)
  - recent events (tool calls, agent transitions, decisions)
  - cost and budget consumption
  - latest LLM activity

Designed to be reactive: the user starts an agent in one terminal, runs
`maverick monitor` in another, and watches the swarm work in real time.

This is the open-source equivalent of Devin's "watch over my shoulder"
UI -- without a paid VM. The plumbing is just the SQLite world model,
which agents write to as they progress.
