"""Tiered world-model storage: hot SQLite + cold archive files (roadmap: 2027 H1 performance).

The world model (``world_model.py``) accumulates ``episodes`` and
``goal_events`` rows forever. Both tables are append-mostly and only the
recent window is read on the hot path (dashboard, recall, monitor), yet every
row stays in SQLite -- the file grows without bound and the hot queries page
through ever-colder index ranges. This module moves rows older than a cutoff
into **cold files** on disk and deletes them from SQLite, keeping the hot
store small while history stays queryable via :func:`read_cold`.

Cold format: **parquet** (via ``pyarrow``, shipped by the ``[pandas]`` extra)
is preferred -- columnar, compressed, readable by any analytics stack. When
pyarrow isn't importable the writer falls back to **gzip JSONL**, which needs
only the stdlib, so archival always works. :func:`read_cold` reads both, so a
mixed directory (one host wrote jsonl, another parquet) is fine. Files are
named ``<table>-<YYYYMMDD>-<YYYYMMDD>.parquet|.jsonl.gz`` after the UTC date
range of the rows inside (a ``-N`` suffix dedupes a same-range rerun).

Safety order, per table: SELECT the expired rows, write the cold file, THEN
delete -- one transaction per table. If the file write fails, nothing is
deleted (the partial file is removed and the error propagates); a row is
never dropped from SQLite unless its bytes are durably in the cold store
first. Tables commit independently, so a failure on the second table leaves
the first one's completed archive intact. Column values are copied verbatim,
so fields sealed by at-rest encryption stay sealed in the cold file.
Episodes still referenced by ``facts.source_episode_id`` are pinned hot
(the world model runs with ``foreign_keys=ON``; deleting them would raise).

This module never runs on its own. The operator (or a cron job) calls
:func:`archive` directly, or :func:`configured_archive`, which is a no-op
returning ``None`` until both knobs are set::
