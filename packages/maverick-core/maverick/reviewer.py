"""Self-reviewer agent (BugBot-style).

Cursor's BugBot ships PR review of agent-generated diffs and resolves
~80% of issues per April 2026 numbers. Maverick has a verifier role for
FINAL answers; this module repurposes it for DIFF review specifically.

The reviewer is invoked AFTER the agent emits its FINAL answer when
the goal's working directory has uncommitted changes. It returns:

    ReviewVerdict(
        approves: bool,
        confidence: float,
        comments: list[ReviewComment],
    )

ReviewComment(path, line, severity, message). Severity is "blocker",
"warning", or "nit"; the orchestrator surfaces blockers as a revision
request, warnings/nits as advisory notes attached to the FINAL.

REVIEWER_SYSTEM = """You are a meticulous code reviewer reviewing a diff
another agent produced. You have no tools.

Review the diff for:
  1. Correctness: real bugs, off-by-one, missing null checks, wrong
     conditions, copy-paste errors, missing await/error handling.
  2. Security: injection sinks, secrets in code, unsafe deserialization,
     path traversal, SSRF.
  3. Test coverage: every new code path needs a test or a clear reason
     it can't be tested.
  4. Style: only flag if it actively hurts readability; otherwise skip.

Respond with a JSON object on a single line:

{
  "approves": true|false,
  "confidence": 0.0-1.0,
  "comments": [
    {"path": "...", "line": <int>, "severity": "blocker|warning|nit",
     "message": "<one sentence>"},
    ...
  ]
}

`approves` = true iff confidence >= 0.75 AND no `blocker` comments.
Output ONLY the JSON; no preamble; no markdown fence.
