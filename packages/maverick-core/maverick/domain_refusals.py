"""Hard refusals for the specialist agents — the prohibited-use list.

Operating discipline (:mod:`maverick.domain_discipline`) shapes how a
professional *works*; a refusal is something the specialist must **refuse
outright**. These are the uses a governed enterprise platform does not gate but
forbids: the EU AI Act Art. 5 prohibitions (HR), safety-critical actuation
(operations / utilities / manufacturing), autonomous clinical or financial
adjudication, MNPI crossing, and the like — named in the agent-suite design as
"refusal lists carried by the profile compiler."

Two properties distinguish this from discipline:

* **Always on.** Discipline is an operator preference (``[domains] discipline``);
  a prohibited use is not. There is no opt-out — the block renders for every
  pack in a covered suite, built-in or operator-authored.
* **Refuse, don't gate.** The other controls (consent, ``require_human``,
  capability) let a human approve an action; a refusal has no approve path. The
  agent declines and escalates.

The block is rendered into the system prompt at spawn (universal + the pack's
suite refusals + any pack-specific ``refuse`` entries). The platform's hard
rails (capability / governance / Shield) still enforce limits independently;
this makes the agent refuse *before* a rail is ever tested.
