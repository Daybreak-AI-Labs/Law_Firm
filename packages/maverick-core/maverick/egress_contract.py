"""Every outbound HTTP path must go through a library the egress guard wraps.

``egress_guard`` moved the enterprise boundary from 11 hand-written per-tool
checks to the ``send`` methods of ``httpx`` and ``requests``, which covers 87
of the 88 production modules that make direct outbound HTTP. That is a real
fix, and it has exactly one way to silently stop being true: someone adds a
connector using a client library the guard does not wrap.

That is not hypothetical -- it is the history of this subsystem. The per-tool
convention was undermined by sixty connectors that simply did not call it, and
nothing failed, because the tests validated the policy *function* and a
handful of hand-picked wrappers. A guarantee that depends on authors
remembering an unenforced convention decays to whatever the least careful
commit did.

So this gate enumerates every production module that issues outbound HTTP and
classifies the library it uses:

``COVERED``    httpx / requests -- the guard's ``send`` wrappers apply
``UNCOVERED``  anything else (aiohttp, urllib, raw sockets, http.client)

An UNCOVERED module is not automatically a build failure -- one exists today
and is recorded below. It is a failure to add a *new* one, or to leave a
recorded one in the list after it has been migrated. The number is a debt
register, not an exemption list.

CLI: ``python -m maverick.egress_contract`` prints the census;
``--ci`` fails on drift; ``--list`` shows every call site.
