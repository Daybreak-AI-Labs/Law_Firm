"""Control/data-plane end-to-end harness + evidence artifact (regulated-SaaS
data-plane split).

The dispatcher seam lets the control plane (the API/dashboard that *accepts* a
goal) hand execution to a separate data plane (a worker process that *runs* it),
so a tenant's runaway goal can't degrade the request path. The unit tests cover
each piece in isolation; this is the missing *end-to-end* proof that the pieces
compose: a goal submitted through the real ``QueueDispatcher`` is executed by a
separate ``Worker`` against the *shared* stores, never on the control path, and
its terminal status flows back through the shared world DB.

It runs the **real** components — ``QueueDispatcher`` (control plane), the SQLite
``JobQueue`` (broker), ``Worker`` (data plane), and two ``WorldModel`` handles on
one shared DB file (standing in for two processes) — with no Redis/gRPC network.
Only the agent execution itself is stubbed at the LLM boundary: the worker's
handler marks the goal done in the shared world instead of driving a real swarm,
because what we're proving is the *plumbing*, not the agent loop.

``run_e2e`` returns a JSON-serializable evidence dict whose ``proof.ok`` is the
single assertion. ``python -m maverick.control_data_plane_e2e --ci`` runs it in a
temp dir and exits non-zero if the split does not hold; ``--out PATH`` writes the
artifact.
