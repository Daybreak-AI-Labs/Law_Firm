"""Provider migration cost calculator (roadmap: 2027 H2 performance).

Answers the procurement question every multi-provider shop eventually asks:
"what would last month have cost on model X?". Given observed usage rows
(token volumes, optionally what they actually cost), :func:`reprice` replays
the *same token volumes* at a target model's list rate from the versioned
pricing provider and reports the delta. This module is planning-only and
explicitly requests estimate rates; no result is suitable for billing.
:func:`compare_matrix` does it across several targets at once, cheapest first.

Honesty matters more than precision here, in three documented ways:

* **Token counts transfer, quality doesn't.** Different vendors tokenize the
  same text differently and produce different-quality output; replaying token
  volumes is lower-bound *arithmetic*, not a benchmark. :func:`render` says so
  in every output.
* **The current side prefers what was actually billed.** A row's
  ``cost_dollars`` (the recorded spend) wins over re-deriving it; only rows
  without one are priced from their ``model`` via the pricing provider.
* **Unpriceable rows are counted, never guessed.** A row with no recorded
  cost and no priceable model is excluded from BOTH sides (so the delta stays
  apples-to-apples) and surfaced in ``unpriceable_rows`` instead of being
  silently billed at some fallback rate.

Usage rows are duck-typed (dicts or attribute objects) with
``in_tokens``/``out_tokens`` (``input_tokens``/``output_tokens`` accepted) as
row totals, optional ``model``, ``cost_dollars`` and ``calls`` (metadata only
— tokens are already totals). :func:`gather_from_world` adapts a world
model's recent episodes (``EpisodeSpend.input_tokens/output_tokens/
cost_dollars``) into rows.

Pure library, stdlib-only, nothing runs unless called.
