"""Linear + Jira inbound triggers — assign an issue to the bot, get a goal.

Mirrors ``github_app.py`` (label an issue, get a PR) for the two other
trackers Maverick already has read/write tools for (``tools/linear.py``,
``tools/jira.py``). When a Linear or Jira issue is *assigned to the bot*,
the receiver creates a Maverick goal from the issue title + body.

Two pure pieces, kept transport-free so they unit-test without a server
(the FastAPI routes live in ``maverick_dashboard.app`` next to
``/webhook/start`` and just call into here):

  - ``verify_signature(body, header, secret)`` — HMAC-SHA256 over the raw
    body. Linear sends a bare hex digest in ``Linear-Signature``; Jira
    automation/Connect senders commonly use a ``sha256=`` prefix. Accept
    both. Empty secret fails CLOSED (unlike github_app's dev fail-open):
    these receivers are mounted on the public dashboard app.
  - ``parse_issue_event(provider, payload)`` — normalize a Linear/Jira
    webhook into an ``IssueEvent`` IFF it is an assignment whose assignee
    is the configured bot. Returns ``None`` for anything else (non-assign
    events, assigned-to-someone-else) so the caller no-ops.

Who is "the bot": set ``MAVERICK_BOT_LINEAR_ID`` (Linear user id) and/or
``MAVERICK_BOT_JIRA_ACCOUNT_ID`` (Jira accountId, or the bot's email).
Matching is case-insensitive and also accepts the assignee's email so an
operator can configure either. With no bot id configured the receiver
fails closed: a signed tracker event alone must not be enough to trigger
Maverick unless the assignee matches an explicitly configured bot.
