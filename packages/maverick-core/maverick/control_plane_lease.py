"""One control plane per data root, enforced at runtime.

The single-replica invariant is asserted in eleven places -- the chart, two raw
manifests, six docs, a runbook -- and enforced in exactly one: a
``helm template`` time guard in ``_helpers.tpl`` that fails on
``replicaCount > 1``. That guard is real, but it is build-time and it is the
only thing standing between a deployment and silent corruption. ``kubectl
apply`` with a hand-edited manifest, ``docker compose up --scale``, a systemd
unit, or simply two ``maverick dashboard`` processes on one host all walk past
it, and nothing downstream notices.

What is at stake is not a crash. The data root holds four hash-chained ledgers
-- the signed audit chain plus its cross-file anchor ledger, budget receipts,
fleet memory, and the learning/promotion NDJSONs -- and roughly 133 named
file-backed state roots besides. Individual writes are serialized by
``file_lock.cross_process_lock``, so two writers do not tear a single record.
They interleave *valid* records into an append-only chain that assumes one
author, which is worse: the corruption is well-formed, it verifies, and it is
discovered when someone tries to reconstruct history from it.

This module supplies the missing runtime check. One process holds an exclusive
advisory lock on a sentinel in the data root for its entire lifetime; a second
refuses to start and says who holds it.

**What this is, precisely.** The authority is an OS advisory lock (``flock``
on POSIX, ``msvcrt`` byte-range on Windows) held on an open descriptor for the
process lifetime. It is not a timed lease and does not need renewing: the
kernel drops the lock when the holder dies, so there is no stale-lock problem
and no expiry to tune. The JSON body of the sentinel -- pid, host, start time,
fencing token -- is *observability*, not the mechanism. It is written by the
holder after it wins, and a second process reads it only to name the winner in
its refusal message. Saying "lease" and shipping a lock would be exactly the
claim-vs-code gap this work exists to close, so: it is a lock.

**The holder record and fencing token.** The OS-lock file contains no mutable
state. A separate atomically replaced ``control-plane-holder.json`` records the
diagnostic holder and the counter incremented under the authority lock on each
successful acquisition. The separation matters on Windows, where a mandatory
byte-range lock prevents another process from reading the locked byte. The
token answers "is the component about to write still the one that holds the
root?" for anything that caches an ownership decision -- a stale holder's token
is lower than the current one and its write can be rejected. Nothing consumes
it for admission yet; it is recorded, exposed on ``/readyz``, and honest about
that.

**Where exclusion does not reach.** Advisory locks bind a kernel, so this
covers processes sharing a host and a data root -- which is the deployment
shape the invariant is about, since the state lives on a ReadWriteOnce volume
attached to one node. Two pods on different nodes with genuinely separate
volumes are separate deployments and share no state to corrupt. The dangerous
in-between is a network filesystem where ``flock`` is silently a no-op: there
the lock would appear to succeed while providing no exclusion at all. That
case fails closed -- if the backend cannot demonstrate locking, the process
refuses to start rather than assume it is alone.
