"""Speculative tool execution: pre-warm the tool-output cache (roadmap: 2027 H1 performance).

An agent's next tool calls are often predictable -- it re-reads the file it
just edited, refreshes the same repo map, polls the same status endpoint.
Each of those re-reads sits on the critical path of a paid model turn. This
module executes *predicted* next calls concurrently, ahead of the model, so
that when the model does ask, the result is already in the tool-output cache
(:mod:`maverick.cache.tool`) and the turn doesn't wait on I/O. A wrong
prediction costs only local work on a side-effect-free read -- never a paid
API call, never a side effect.

Hard rules:
  * Only tools that exist in the registry AND are ``parallel_safe`` (the
    same side-effect-free invariant the agent loop and the cache use) are
    ever speculated; everything else is reported as skipped.
  * Candidates already cached are skipped -- no duplicate work.
  * Results land via ``tool_cache.store_cached``, which never memoizes
    error results, so a speculative failure can't poison a real turn.
  * :func:`speculate` never raises: per-candidate failures are swallowed
    into the report. An optional ``budget_guard`` is consulted before each
    execution so the caller can stop speculation the moment budget is tight.
  * When the tool-output cache itself is disabled the whole call is a no-op:
    there is nowhere to store results, so executing would be pure waste.

Off by default. ``enabled()`` is the opt-in switch the integration point
checks (``MAVERICK_SPECULATIVE_TOOLS=1`` or ``[tools] speculative = true``);
the module itself is a library -- it never runs on its own and
:func:`speculate` does exactly what the caller asked, when asked.

Distinct from :mod:`maverick.speculative` (the asyncio overlapped-coroutine
primitive): this module is about warming the cross-turn tool cache from
predictions, not overlapping in-flight coroutines.
