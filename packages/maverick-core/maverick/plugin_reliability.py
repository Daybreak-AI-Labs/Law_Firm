"""Long-running plugin reliability suite (roadmap: 2028 H2 ecosystem).

The TS / gRPC / in-process plugin hosts each claim reliability properties —
a crashed child is restarted and the call retried once, a timeout becomes an
``ERROR`` not a hang, a bad call doesn't poison the next. Their unit tests pin
that in the small; this is the **sustained-load drill** an operator runs
against *their* installed plugins to confirm the properties hold over
thousands of calls under injected faults — the plugin counterpart to the
chaos game-day.

It is host-agnostic: you give it ``call(payload) -> str`` (the plugin tool's
``fn``, or a host child's call seam) and a fault script; the harness drives N
calls, injecting crashes / timeouts / slow responses / errors at configured
rates through an **injected** fault function, and asserts the reliability
**properties**:

* **recovery** — a crash-shaped failure is followed by a *successful* call
  (the host restarted the child), i.e. no permanent wedging;
* **isolation** — an error/timeout on one call never changes the result of the
  next clean call (no cross-call state poisoning);
* **error rate** — surfaced failures stay within a tolerance once transient
  faults are absorbed;
* **no unbounded growth** — an injected memory sampler shows no monotonic climb
  (sawtooth OK), catching a leaking plugin.

Deterministic: the fault schedule is a seeded PRNG and the clock is injected,
so the drill runs in milliseconds and the same seed reproduces the same run.
``python -m maverick.plugin_reliability`` runs the built-in self-drill (a
scripted flaky plugin) and exits non-zero if any property fails — a CI gate.
