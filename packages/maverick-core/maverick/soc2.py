"""SOC 2 evidence collector — a machine-readable posture snapshot.

A SOC 2 audit (and any continuous-compliance automation in front of one) needs
to answer a simple question on demand: *which technical controls are actually
ON in this deployment right now, and is the tamper-evident audit log intact?*
This module answers it.

:func:`collect_soc2_evidence` returns a structured dict an auditor or a
``maverick soc2`` CLI command (a deliberate follow-on — see
``docs/compliance/soc2-controls.md``) can serialize to JSON and attach to an
evidence request. It probes the live configuration:

  - capability enforcement (``maverick.capability.capability_enforced``)
  - per-user tenant isolation (``maverick.paths.tenant_by_user_enabled``)
  - per-principal usage quotas (``maverick.quotas.quotas_enforced``)
  - OIDC auth verifier (``maverick.oidc.oidc_enabled``) — optional module
  - encryption at rest (``maverick.crypto_at_rest.at_rest_enabled``)
  - data-subject export / DSAR (``maverick.dsar.export_subject_data`` present)
  - the append-only Ed25519 Merkle-chained audit log: does it verify, and is a
    signing key present?

Design contract — this module is **fail-soft and import-light**:

  - It never raises. A probe that errors, or whose backing module is absent,
    is reported with ``status`` ``"unknown"`` (probe error) or ``"absent"``
    (module not installed) — never a crash. SOC 2 evidence collection must not
    be able to take down the host it is auditing. This explicitly includes
    ``BaseException``: a half-installed native crypto backend can ``panic`` (a
    pyo3 ``PanicException`` is a ``BaseException``, not an ``Exception``), and
    even that must degrade to ``"unknown"`` rather than abort the snapshot.
  - Every dependency is imported lazily inside the probe, so ``import
    maverick.soc2`` succeeds even when optional features (oidc/quotas) or
    ``cryptography`` are not installed.

The snapshot is descriptive, not prescriptive: ``"absent"``/``"unknown"`` are
honest states, not failures. The mapping of these controls to the SOC 2 Trust
Services Criteria lives in ``docs/compliance/soc2-controls.md``.
