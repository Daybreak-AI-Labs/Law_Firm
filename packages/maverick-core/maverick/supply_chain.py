"""Supply-chain pinning: a pin-and-verify ledger for the dependency tree
(roadmap: 2027 H2 safety).

An agent runtime is only as trustworthy as the packages loaded into its
process: a quietly upgraded transitive dependency (or a typosquat pulled in by
a hotfix ``pip install``) changes what the kernel *is* without any code review
seeing it. The cheap, offline guard is a pin file: snapshot the installed
distribution set at deploy time, then verify the live environment against it
on later runs and surface any drift.

Pieces:

* :func:`snapshot` — ``{name: version}`` for every installed distribution via
  ``importlib.metadata.distributions()``. Names are normalized per PEP 503
  (lowercase; runs of ``-_.`` collapse to ``-``) so ``Foo_Bar`` and
  ``foo-bar`` can never read as drift. When the same distribution is visible
  twice on ``sys.path`` the first wins, matching import resolution order.
* :func:`write_pins` — persist ``{"generated_at": iso, "pins": {...}}`` as
  JSON, by default under ``data_dir("supply_chain_pins.json")``. The write is
  atomic (tmp + ``os.replace``) and 0600: the pin file is an integrity
  reference, so a torn write or a co-tenant edit must not be representable.
* :func:`verify` — compare a live snapshot against the pins and return a
  :class:`PinReport`: ``missing`` (pinned but no longer installed),
  ``drifted`` (``(name, pinned, installed)`` version changes) and
  ``unpinned`` (installed but never pinned — a *warning*, not a failure,
  because optional extras legitimately come and go). ``ok`` iff nothing is
  missing and nothing drifted.
* :func:`render` — readable report with a PASS/FAIL verdict.
* :func:`check_or_warn` — the kernel-facing convenience: when ``[safety]
  supply_chain_pinning`` is enabled (env ``MAVERICK_SUPPLY_CHAIN_PINNING``
  wins over config) AND a pin file exists, verify and ``log.warning`` on
  FAIL. It never raises and never blocks startup — drift is evidence for an
  operator, and the fail-open kernel rule applies. Default OFF: with no
  config and no env var this whole module is inert.

Stdlib-only, no network, deterministic given the same installed set (tests
fake ``importlib.metadata.distributions``).
