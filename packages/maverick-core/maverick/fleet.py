"""Agent fleets -- Layer C of the enterprise control plane.

(See ``docs/enterprise/architecture.md``.) A **Fleet** is the per-employee unit
of the product: an *owner* (a human principal) plus a roster of named,
role-scoped **agents** that do ongoing work. Each agent's role drives its
capability (via ``[roles.<role>]`` RBAC) and the whole fleet runs under the
oversight control plane (``maverick.governance``).

This module is the persistent model + lifecycle (create / list / show / remove).
Binding a fleet's agents to live runs (spawn, schedule, supervise) is built on
top of this registry.

Fleets are stored as JSON at ``~/.maverick/fleets/<name>.json``, tenant-aware via
:func:`maverick.paths.data_dir`, so one tenant's fleet roster never leaks to
another.
