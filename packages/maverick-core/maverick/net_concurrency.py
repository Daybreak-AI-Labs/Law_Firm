"""Per-host concurrency caps for parallel network-read tools (#434).

The agent loop runs a turn's ``parallel_safe`` tool calls concurrently
(asyncio.gather). Idempotent network reads (http_fetch, arxiv, wikipedia,
semantic_scholar, hackernews) are parallel_safe, so a turn that fans out
many reads to the SAME host can hammer it / trip rate limits. This module
gates each network read behind a per-host asyncio.Semaphore so same-host
reads are throttled while cross-host reads stay fully concurrent.

Local reads (read_file / list_dir / repo_map / dep_graph) have no host key
and are never gated. Unknown tools return no host key too, so this is a
strict refinement: anything it doesn't recognise behaves exactly as before.

Tunable: ``MAVERICK_NET_HOST_CONCURRENCY`` (default 4). 0 or negative
disables gating entirely.

# Per-event-loop semaphore registries. A Semaphore binds to a loop the first
# time it is awaited, so a single shared registry broke under the platform's OWN
# concurrency: runner.run_goal_in_thread / orchestrator.run_goal_sync run each
# goal under its own asyncio.run() on a worker thread, so two goals are two live
# loops on two threads. The old single `_sem_loop` flip-flopped between them --
# each clear() wiping the other's registry (an unsynchronized data race), and a
# semaphore created for loop A could then be awaited under loop B ("bound to a
# different loop"). We keep one registry PER loop, keyed by the loop in a
# WeakKeyDictionary (auto-evicts a dead loop, so a recycled id() can't alias
# it), and guard all access with a lock -- WeakKeyDictionary mutation is not
# itself thread-safe across the concurrent loops that reach here.
