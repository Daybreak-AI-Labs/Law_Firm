"""Failure-policy classification lint (auditability).

Every broad exception handler in the audit-integrity subsystem must declare its
intended failure mode, so an auditor (or a reviewer) can see — machine-checked —
whether an error path:

  - ``fail_closed``           — denies / stops / raises / reports a break;
  - ``fail_soft_with_audit``  — degrades but logs or records the degradation;
  - ``best_effort``           — swallows an optional optimization, safe to drop.

A "broad" handler is ``except Exception``, ``except BaseException``, or a bare
``except:``. The declaration is a marker comment

    # failure-policy: <fail_closed | fail_soft_with_audit | best_effort>

on the ``except`` line (as a trailing comment) or on the line immediately above
it. Anything after the class token (e.g. ``-- reason``) is free text.

Scope is **intentionally narrow** — the audit-log subsystem (``maverick/audit``),
where a silently-swallowed error is a genuine tamper-evidence gap. flake8-bugbear
stays off repo-wide on purpose (127 latent, mostly-intentional findings); this is
a targeted gate, not a codebase-wide except-handler sweep. Expand coverage by
adding paths to ``SCOPED_FILES`` — every added file must then have all of its
broad handlers classified.

CLI: ``python -m maverick.failure_policy --ci`` exits non-zero on any unmarked or
mis-marked handler in scope.
