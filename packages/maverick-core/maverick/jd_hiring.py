"""Hire from a job description: map a JD onto the specialist roster, or draft
a new clamped specialist pack from it.

HR uploads a job description. :func:`match_jd` ranks the full roster (shipped
packs plus tenant custom packs) against the JD via the hybrid domain router --
deterministic, offline, no LLM required. :func:`draft_from_jd` turns the JD
into a generated :class:`~maverick.domain.DomainProfile` through the same
intake pipeline ``maverick onboard`` uses, so a JD-authored agent arrives
clamped (``validate_profile``: shell/write/exec denied, risk capped at medium)
and only becomes real through the existing human-approved save paths
(``intake.save_profile`` / the dashboard pack editor). :func:`add_pack_to_fleet`
puts a hired specialist on a team roster so fleets and department deploys can
dispatch it like any shipped pack.
