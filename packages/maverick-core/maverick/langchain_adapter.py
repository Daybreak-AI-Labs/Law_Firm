"""LangChain / LangGraph interop.

Two directions, both behind the ``[langchain]`` extra:

  - **Lightwork as a LangChain tool** — :func:`maverick_langchain_tool` returns a
    LangChain ``StructuredTool`` that delegates a goal to the Lightwork swarm and
    returns its result, so a LangChain/LangGraph agent can call Lightwork as one
    of its tools.
  - **A LangChain tool as a Lightwork tool** — :func:`wrap_langchain_tool` adapts
    any LangChain ``BaseTool`` into a Lightwork :class:`~maverick.tools.Tool`, so
    the swarm can use the LangChain ecosystem's tools.

The delegation core (:func:`run_maverick_goal`) is transport-agnostic and
unit-tested with injected fakes; the LangChain wrappers lazy-import
``langchain_core`` and raise a clear install hint when the extra is absent.
