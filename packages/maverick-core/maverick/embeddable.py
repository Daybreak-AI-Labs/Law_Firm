"""Embeddable-mode markers.

Library users who import ``maverick`` to drive an agent from inside
their own app don't want Maverick's CLI cost: click imports, command
discovery, plugin entry-point scanning, etc. They can set
``MAVERICK_NO_CLI=1`` in the environment before importing, and the
core kernel skips CLI-only paths.

This module is the source of truth for the flag. Tools and entry-
points that are NOT needed in embedded mode check ``no_cli()`` and
short-circuit.
