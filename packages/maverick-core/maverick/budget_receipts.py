"""Cryptographic budget receipts: tamper-evident spend records
(roadmap: 2028 H1 safety).

A spend number in a mutable JSON file is an assertion, not evidence. When an
agent platform bills (or is audited on) what its runs cost, the operator
needs receipts that (a) can't be quietly edited after the fact and (b) can't
be quietly *deleted* — an over-budget run that simply vanishes from the
ledger is the same lie as one whose total was shaved.

So a receipt is:

* the run's spend gathered from the world model's episode rows
  (:class:`maverick.world_model.EpisodeSpend`: ``cost_dollars`` /
  ``input_tokens`` / ``output_tokens`` / ``tool_calls`` per episode of the
  goal), plus the deployment's ``[budget]`` caps for context;
* serialized as **canonical JSON** (sorted keys, fixed separators — byte
  stability is what makes a MAC meaningful);
* **HMAC-SHA256-signed** with a deployment receipt key (``[safety]
  receipt_key`` / env ``MAVERICK_RECEIPT_KEY``, env wins). No key configured
  -> :func:`mint` refuses with :class:`ReceiptKeyMissing` — an unsigned
  receipt is worthless, and silently minting one would teach operators to
  trust paper;
* **hash-chained**: each receipt's signed payload embeds
  ``prev_receipt_hash`` (sha256 of the previous receipt line in
  ``data_dir("budget_receipts.jsonl")``, ``None`` for the genesis receipt),
  and is appended to that file (created 0600, append-only). Deleting or
  reordering a line breaks the chain at a verifiable spot.

HMAC (symmetric) rather than Ed25519: the verifier and the minter are the
same deployment boundary here, stdlib ``hmac``/``hashlib`` need no extra
dependency, and the audit subsystem's asymmetric signing stays available for
receipts that must cross trust boundaries later.

Pure library, default OFF (nothing mints unless called; no key, no mint).
The clock is injectable for tests. Fail-soft only in the *config* reads —
verification itself never fails soft: a bad signature is ``INVALID``, a
malformed blob is ``MALFORMED``, loudly.
