"""Agent Trust Plane — the single registry + decision point for talking to
*external* agents.

Lightwork grew several independent cross-agent pathways, each with its own
enable flag, its own auth model, and its own "who's allowed" list:

  * federation (``[federation] peers``)        — shared-secret tokens;
  * A2A tasks (``[a2a]``)                       — a single bearer token;
  * fleet memory (``agents.ndjson`` roster)     — a registration list;
  * channel/marketplace federation             — Ed25519 pinned keys.

So the one question a company actually asks — *"which outside agents may our
agents talk to, and what may they do or see?"* — had no single answer; it was
smeared across five config surfaces in three incompatible identity models, the
weakest of which (a symmetric shared secret) sat on the most powerful path
(goal delegation).

This module is the rebuild: **one registry** (``[agent_trust] agents``) that
names every trusted external agent by its *pinned Ed25519 public key* (the same
asymmetric identity ``federation_envelope`` already uses), declares the
**direction** it may communicate, and bounds **what it may do** (a tool/risk
ceiling), **how much it may spend** (a budget ceiling), and **what company data
it may read** (data scopes). And **one decision point** —
:func:`decide_inbound` / :func:`decide_outbound` — that every transport
consults before a cross-agent interaction.

**Posture (default-deny at the boundary, open in-process).** The trust plane is
*engaged* exactly when :func:`agent_trust_enforced` is true — automatically
under enterprise mode (the "I handle sensitive data" switch, mirroring
:func:`maverick.capability.capability_enforced`), or explicitly via
``[agent_trust] enforce = true`` / ``MAVERICK_AGENT_TRUST=1``. When engaged, an
external agent absent from the registry is **denied** (zero-trust at the
company edge). When *not* engaged it is a strict no-op — every decision is
ALLOW with no ceiling — so kernel rule 1 (default-open, fail-open) and every
existing deployment behave byte-for-byte as before. In-process peer messaging
(``agent_bus``) is internal and never gated here.

Pure and offline (no I/O beyond reading config), so the decision logic is
exhaustively unit-testable; wiring it into each transport is a separate,
deliberate step.

Registry format (``~/.maverick/config.toml``)::

    [agent_trust]
    enforce = true                       # or rely on [enterprise] mode
    agents = [
      { id = "vega", pubkey = "<64-hex Ed25519>", direction = "both",

    throwaway decision object. A denial is a security-relevant event, so it
    lands in the Operating Record alongside capability/governance denials.
    Ordinary audit outages remain fail-soft. A policy/custody refusal
    propagates so a denied trust decision cannot be reported as fully recorded
    when the configured audit guarantee explicitly declined the write.
