"""Governed connectors -- act on external systems of record through typed,
audited Actions (NOT a data-integration platform).

Palantir borrow #4, kept on-strategy: agents must read and write systems of
record (CRM, ticketing, ERP) -- but every such operation should be a typed,
risk-classed, lineage-tracked :class:`~maverick.governed_actions.ActionSpec`,
never a raw call. A :class:`Connector` adapts one external system into governed
Actions named ``<connector>.read`` (low risk) and ``<connector>.write`` (high
risk, so it hits the approval floor): each previews its effect before commit and
records a lineage link after.

This ships the FRAMEWORK + a reference in-memory connector; a real connector
(Salesforce, ServiceNow, SAP, ...) implements the same tiny surface against a
live system. Opt-in/additive -- registering a connector is an explicit choice.
