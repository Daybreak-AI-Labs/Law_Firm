"""Append-only shared workspace for a single run.

Specialists never talk to each other directly. They post observations,
findings, and artifacts to the blackboard. The orchestrator reads it to
decide what to do next.

v0.1.3: blackboard now optionally mirrors entries into ``world.goal_events``
so the dashboard can stream live progress. Wiring is opt-in via
``Blackboard.attach_world(world, goal_id)`` so unit tests + the old
behavior keep working.
