"""Modal sandbox backend (roadmap: 2027 H2 ecosystem — "Cloudflare Workers +
Modal sandboxes").

Runs agent shell commands in `Modal Sandboxes <https://modal.com/docs/guide/sandbox>`_
— ephemeral cloud containers with hard resource limits — so a Lightwork on a
laptop can execute untrusted work on burstable remote compute without running
its own cluster. Satisfies sandbox SDK v2 (``workdir`` + ``exec(cmd,
timeout=None)``); select with ``[sandbox] backend = "modal"``.

The Cloudflare-Workers half of the roadmap item is **declined for shell
semantics**: Workers run JS/WASM request handlers, not processes — there is no
honest ``exec("pytest ...")`` on that platform. The Workers deployment story
is covered where it fits: the self-hosted relay reference (a Worker-shaped
HTTP shim) and ``wasm_run`` (WASI module execution). A "sandbox backend" that
silently downgraded shell to something else would violate the contract.

``modal`` is the ``[modal]`` extra, imported lazily; per-call sandboxes are
created with the configured image/cpu/memory/timeout and torn down after the
command. Modal does not currently expose a per-sandbox no-egress switch here,
so ``allow_network=false`` fails closed instead of silently running with
provider-default networking. The Modal client object is injectable so tests run
offline.
