"""Shared reliability policy for tool dispatch.

~80 tools are thin API wrappers with no retry/backoff of their own. Rather
than make each author hand-roll a retry loop, ``ToolRegistry.run`` routes
every call through this one policy:

  * Only genuinely *transient* upstream failures are retried -- rate limits,
    network errors, and 5xx -- reusing the classified backoff the LLM path
    already uses (``retry_classifier``). A generic tool exception (bad args,
    missing file, a logic bug) classifies as UNKNOWN and is **not** retried:
    re-running a deterministic failure just burns budget and wall-clock.
  * Only low/medium-risk tools are auto-retried. High-risk tools (writes,
    payments, messaging, infra, device control, spawn -- per
    ``safety.tool_risk``) run exactly once: a transient error raised *after*
    a partial side-effect must never be silently re-fired.

Fail-open: the risk lookup never blocks a call, and a non-retryable error or
tool re-raises so the registry keeps its own error-to-string handling.
