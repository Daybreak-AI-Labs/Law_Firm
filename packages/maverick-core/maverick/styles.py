"""User-selectable output styles (the Claude "styles" analog).

A style is a short guidance block appended to every agent's system prompt -- it
shapes *tone and format only*, never capabilities, tools, or the safety surface
(exactly like :mod:`maverick.persona`, but user-picked at runtime rather than
operator-configured). The ACTIVE style is the dashboard runtime overlay
(``styles.active`` in ``runtime-overrides.toml``); unset = no style block, i.e.
today's default voice.

Built-ins live here. Custom user styles and per-conversation selection are
deliberate follow-ons; this module is the registry + the prompt renderer.
