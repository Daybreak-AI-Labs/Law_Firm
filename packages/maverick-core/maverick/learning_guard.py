"""Operational stop boundary shared by every learning loop.

Learning jobs do not run through the agent kernel, so the kernel's turn/tool
checks cannot stop them.  This small boundary deliberately reuses the global
killswitch instead of inventing a second flag: the local HALT file,
in-process halt, and shared Postgres halt therefore stop agents and learning
workers with the same operator action.

Callers check at job start and again immediately before expensive evaluation
or a durable learned-state transition.  ``Halted`` is a control-flow signal;
callers may surface it as a refused report, but must never continue the phase.
Unlike the availability-first agent hot path, this boundary also treats an
unreadable configured HALT authority as active and refuses the transition.
Recovery and rollback code intentionally do not use this guard so an operator
can restore a known-good state while the emergency stop remains armed.
