"""Crash-only logging: a sink that is safe to ``kill -9`` at any byte
(roadmap: 2027 H2 safety).

Post-incident forensics are only as good as the last record that actually
reached disk. A buffered logger loses its tail on SIGKILL/OOM — exactly the
records describing the crash — and a torn final line can poison naive readers
of everything before it. This sink makes the failure mode boring:

* **Append-only JSONL, one fsync'd write per record.** :meth:`CrashOnlyLog.append`
  serializes the record, issues a single ``os.write`` to an ``O_APPEND`` fd,
  then ``os.fsync``. There is no in-memory buffer, no background flusher and
  no ``close()`` required for durability: once ``append`` returns, the record
  survives ``kill -9`` and (modulo storage lies) power loss.
* **Monotonic ``seq``** persisted in every record. On reopen the writer scans
  the file and resumes from the last *intact* record, so sequence numbers
  stay monotonic across process deaths; :func:`verify` detects holes (an
  append that raised after incrementing, or external truncation).
* **Torn-tail recovery.** A crash mid-write legally leaves one incomplete
  final line. :func:`replay` parses only newline-terminated lines as records;
  an unterminated tail is kept iff it parses as a complete record (a strict
  prefix of a JSON object can never parse, so a half-written record cannot be
  misread as data) and otherwise discarded and flagged ``torn_tail``.
  Unparseable lines *before* the tail are not a legal crash artifact of this
  writer; they are counted in ``corrupt`` instead. On reopen the writer seals
  an unterminated tail with a newline so new appends never splice into it.
* **fsync policy knob** for tests/throughput runs: ``[logging]
  crash_only_fsync = "always"|"never"`` (env ``MAVERICK_CRASH_ONLY_FSYNC``
  wins). Default ``"always"`` — that IS the feature; ``"never"`` keeps the
  same format and recovery but trades the per-record durability guarantee for
  speed, so it is documented strictly as a test/bulk mode. The policy is
  resolved once at construction (a config read per append would dwarf the
  write), and a ``fsync=`` constructor argument overrides both for direct
  injection.

The log file is created 0600. The clock is injectable (``clock=``) so tests
are deterministic. Stdlib-only, thread-safe (one lock around seq+write), and
purely a library: nothing imports or enables it by default.
