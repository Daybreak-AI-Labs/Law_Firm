"""DuckDB analytics over the world model (roadmap: 2027 H2 ecosystem).

The roadmap lists a "DuckDB world-model". As the *live transactional* store
that's the wrong tool — DuckDB is an OLAP engine, and the agent's world model
is a concurrent OLTP write path that SQLite (WAL) / Postgres serve correctly.
What DuckDB is genuinely great at is the **analytics** over that history:
percentiles, time-bucketed spend, ad-hoc ``GROUP BY`` across thousands of
goals — queries that are verbose and slow in hand-rolled Python.

So this is the DuckDB layer that earns its keep: load the world model's goals
and episodes into an in-memory DuckDB (no extension download, fully offline)
and run analytical SQL. Ad-hoc queries are constrained to a single
``SELECT``/``WITH`` subquery, capped at a bounded number of returned rows, and
run with DuckDB external file access disabled. Behind the ``[duckdb]`` extra.
