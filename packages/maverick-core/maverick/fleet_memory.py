"""Fleet memory: the agent-agnostic learning plane (Learning System of Record).

Maverick's learning loops were built for Maverick agents; this opens them to
ANY agent — Agentforce, Copilot, custom, open-source runtimes — so the
enterprise gets ONE governed memory across its whole fleet. Two operations:

* :func:`ingest` — an external agent deposits experience (a success, a
  failure, or an explicit lesson). Every record is schema-validated,
  size-capped, secret-redacted, Shield-scanned, provenance-tagged
  (``vendor:agent_id``), tenant-isolated, and audited. Successes/failures
  land in the fleet inbox as donation-shaped records (the dream cycle
  consolidates them alongside native experience); lessons land as
  provenance-tagged reflexions so recall surfaces them immediately.
* :func:`recall` — an external agent queries governed memory for a task.
  Reads are scoped (department boost; user-preference notes are NEVER
  exposed — they stay private to their channel/user) and every read is
  audited, so "which agent learned what, and who recalled it" is provable.

Off by default (``[fleet_memory] enable`` / ``MAVERICK_FLEET_MEMORY=1``):
exposing the memory plane to third-party agents is an explicit trust
decision. Fail-open internals, fail-closed surface (disabled = refuse;
unregistered agents = refuse).
