# maverick-core

The Lightwork agent kernel. A recursive multi-agent swarm with persistent
world model, shared blackboard, hard budget caps, and closed-loop skill
learning.

See the [top-level README](../../README.md) and
[`ARCHITECTURE.md`](../../ARCHITECTURE.md) for the full picture.

This package installs on its own (PyPI publish is pending the first tagged
release; install from a source clone for now):

```bash
pip install -e packages/maverick-core   # `pip install maverick-agent` once published
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
maverick start "your goal"
```

But you probably want `pipx install maverick-agent` (once published) +
`maverick init` instead, which also pulls in the safety layer and configures
per-role model choice.
