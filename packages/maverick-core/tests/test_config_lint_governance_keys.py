"""config-lint must recognize the flagship governance config keys.

Client-journey finding (round 5): a regulated client configured the two
headline governance features straight from the docs --

    [audit]
    sign = true
    [capabilities]
    enforce = true

-- and `maverick config-lint` flagged [audit] as an unknown section ("did
you mean auth?") and capabilities.enforce as an unknown key, telling them
their flagship signed-audit + capability-enforcement config looked like
typos. Both are real keys the runtime reads (audit/writer.py:_resolve_signing,
capability.py:capability_enforced). The deferred_tools knob was missing too.
