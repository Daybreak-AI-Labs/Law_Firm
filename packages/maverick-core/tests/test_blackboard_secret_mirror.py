"""Secrets posted to the blackboard must not PERSIST/DISPLAY in cleartext.

Security finding (round 7, adversarial): Blackboard.post() mirrored content
verbatim into world.goal_events (persisted to world.db and streamed live to
the dashboard), the replay trace, and the observation channel -- none
redacted. An agent that reports a credential it found ("the DB password is X")
leaked that secret to disk and to any dashboard viewer, even in a fully local
deployment, and regardless of the audit log's own redaction.

The in-memory blackboard (the agents' shared working memory) stays verbatim so
agent workflows that legitimately pass a value between siblings are unbroken --
same split the audit log uses (the live agent operates on real data; the
persisted/displayed record is redacted).
