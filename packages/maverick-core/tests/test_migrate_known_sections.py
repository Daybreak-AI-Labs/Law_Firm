"""`maverick migrate` must not lint REAL config sections as unread.

Platform-test finding (round 3): the fast wizard writes [capabilities] and
[security], the advanced wizard writes [models] -- and `maverick migrate`
told the user all three "are not sections the runtime reads; silently does
nothing." Acting on that advice would delete live configuration (the whole
self-hosted setup runs through [models]). KNOWN_SECTIONS held 44 names while
the runtime reads ~90; this pins the wizard-written and kernel-core ones.
