"""Plan-name validation: a mistyped plan must not silently downgrade a tenant.

``billing.entitlements_for`` resolves an unknown plan to the ``free``
entitlements, so an operator who typos ``--plan pro`` would believe a tenant is
paid when it is not. ``known_plan_names`` + the registry/CLI warnings make that
mistake visible (purchase-blocker audit #79)."""
