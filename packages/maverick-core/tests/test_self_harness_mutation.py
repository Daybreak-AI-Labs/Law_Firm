"""Mutation-surfaced coverage battery for the self-harness loop.

Mutation testing (mutate a critical predicate, run the suite, confirm a test
dies) was run over self_harness.py. 10 of 12 mutants were killed by the existing
batteries -- including every correctness/security predicate (scope guard, support
floor, the Cc/Cf sanitizer set, the score-range and regression/no-op validation
gates, the per-model cap, the minimal-length bound) and the strongest-first
signature ordering. Two mutants SURVIVED, exposing real gaps; this file closes
them so those mutants now die too.

  M10  Dropping the in-process ``_lock`` (leaving only the cross-process flock)
       did NOT fail the concurrency battery -- because on POSIX ``flock``
       happens to serialize threads as well, so it masked the loss. But
       ``file_lock`` documents that ``flock`` DEGRADES TO A NO-OP where it is
       unavailable on a POSIX/exotic FS, and there the in-process ``_lock`` is
       the ONLY thing serializing concurrent passes. That fallback path had
       no test. ``test_in_process_lock_is_sole_serializer_without_flock`` makes
       the cross-process lock a no-op (simulating that platform) and proves the
       in-process lock alone loses no updates -- so removing it now fails here.

  M9   The signature summarizer's documented behavior -- pick the MOST FREQUENT
       failure message for the cluster's signature -- was never asserted, so a
       tie-break swapped to "longest" survived. ``test_signature_uses_most_*``
       pins it.

(A third mutant -- removing ``math.isfinite`` from validation -- is a genuine
EQUIVALENT mutant: the ``0.0 <= s <= 1.0`` range check already rejects inf/nan,
since every comparison against them is False. It cannot be killed by behavior
and is kept only as defensive/self-documenting code.)
