"""Shared test fixtures for maverick-core.

Provides:
  - ``fake_llm``: a scripted ``FakeLLM`` instance that replaces ``maverick.llm.LLM``
    in tests. Push ``LLMResponse`` objects to ``scripted`` and the agent loop
    pops them in order. Recorded calls available on ``.calls`` for assertions.
  - ``make_llm_response``: helper to build LLMResponse fixtures quickly.

Using this pattern is the only way to test the recursive agent loop and the
OpenAI translator without burning API credits in CI.

    """Point user-home resolution at a per-test temp dir on every platform.

    maverick resolves ``~/.maverick`` via ``Path.home()`` in ~30 places. On
    Windows ``Path.home()`` reads ``USERPROFILE`` and ignores the ``$HOME``
    that tests monkeypatch, so the suite (a) read the developer's REAL home
    (PermissionError on pre-existing world-readable files) and (b) WROTE fake
    sessions/config into the real ``~/.maverick`` (cross-run pollution — a
    leftover ``____evil`` session proved it). Set both ``HOME`` and the Windows
    vars so ``Path.home()`` is isolated everywhere.

    POSIX: this just sets ``HOME`` to a temp dir (what tests already do), so it
    is effectively a no-op and cannot regress Linux CI; a test that sets its own
    ``HOME`` still overrides this.
