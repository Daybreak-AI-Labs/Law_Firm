"""Fault-injection / chaos battery for the self-harness loop.

A learning pass must NEVER perturb the run that hosts it: its docstring promises
it "never raises", and the store it persists must never end up corrupt, partially
written, or littered with stray temp files -- even when the machinery underneath
it is actively failing (disk full, read-only FS, a corrupt store on disk, the
gate throwing, audit/secrets/proposer throwing).

The earlier batteries (example / fuzz / model-based / metamorphic / concurrency)
all assumed the I/O and the injected seams SUCCEED. This one assumes they fail.
It injects an exception (or a corrupt store) at each fault boundary and asserts
the contract holds regardless:

  C1  run_self_harness NEVER raises -- a fault becomes a skipped entry, not a
      propagated exception.
  C2  The harness never WRITES corruption. A corrupt pre-existing store is
      quarantined in place and the defensive recall path yields no prompt data.
  C3  No stale temp file is ever left next to the store.
  C4  On a WRITE fault the store is unchanged from its pre-pass content -- the
      publication is atomic, so it's all-or-nothing, never a torn write.

This is the battery that found the stale-``.tmp`` leak: the old ``_write_addenda``
hand-rolled a fixed ``<name>.tmp`` with no cleanup, so a failed publication left
``addenda.tmp`` behind (and an unlocked rollback racing a locked apply could
collide on that shared name). Routing through ``file_lock.atomic_write_text``
(unique private temp + cleanup-on-failure) closed both. Faults are injected at
that writer's active platform boundary: POSIX uses a path rename, while Windows
uses handle-bound publication so an attacker cannot swap the staged path.
