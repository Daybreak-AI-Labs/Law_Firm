"""Contract tests for the embeddable widget (extensions/widget).

Lives here — not under extensions/ — because the repo's pytest testpaths
(packages/apps/benchmarks) don't collect extensions/, same reason the
demo-cluster and multiarch contract tests live in this directory.

Static validation: the JS parses, talks only to the real dashboard endpoint
with the exact auth header the middleware accepts, pulls nothing from a CDN,
and the demo page wires it up same-origin.
