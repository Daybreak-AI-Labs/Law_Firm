"""openapi_runner bounds model/user-supplied HTTP bodies (DoS guard).

``safe_client`` only validates the host -- it does not cap the response size.
Before this fix ``_load_spec`` and ``_op_call`` did ``r.text``, buffering the
entire body into memory before parsing/truncating, so a spec/endpoint URL
pointing at an endless body exhausted memory. Both now stream with a hard byte
ceiling (mirroring ``http_fetch._stream_fetch``). These tests prove only the
capped prefix is ever read off the wire.
