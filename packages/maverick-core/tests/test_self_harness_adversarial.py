"""Adversarial input-fuzzing battery for the self-harness loop (security lens).

The earlier batteries proved the loop is *correct* and *robust*. This one treats
the recalled addendum as an **attack surface**: it is composed from failure-trace
text (and, with an LLM proposer, from raw model output), it lands in EVERY system
prompt for that model, and it is written verbatim into the signed audit log and
``addenda.json`` that a human operator reviews. So a hostile or buggy proposer
must not be able to smuggle anything dangerous through ``_sanitize_line`` into
that block.

Threat model -- three classes the ASCII-only ``[\\x00-\\x1f\\x7f]`` filter missed:

  * **C1 control bytes** (0x80-0x9f). Cat'ing the audit log or addenda.json in a
    terminal interprets 0x9b as a CSI -- terminal-escape / log injection.
  * **Zero-width chars** (ZWSP/ZWNJ/ZWJ, BOM). Splits a trigger word past a
    downstream keyword filter; invisible in review.
  * **Bidi overrides** (RLO/LRO/isolates). Visually reverses the guidance an
    auditor reads vs. what the model is actually told.

The contract this asserts, both at the ``propose_addendum`` seam and end-to-end
through a full promoting pass into ``recall_addendum``:

  S1  No control (Unicode cat ``Cc``) or format (``Cf``) char ever reaches a
      recalled bullet -- the whole non-ASCII slice, not just C0/DEL.
  S2  No multi-line break-out: a bullet is one line; the block's only newlines
      are its own framing, and no injected ``- `` bullet appears.
  S3  No secret token survives into the block.
  S4  Scoped (remote/attacker-influenced) traces NEVER influence the addendum,
      however they are mixed with unscoped ones.

This battery found the category gap: ``_sanitize_line`` stripped only the ASCII
control slice, so C1 bytes, zero-width chars and bidi overrides rode straight
through. It now strips by Unicode category (``Cc``/``Cf``).
