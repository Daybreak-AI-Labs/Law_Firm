"""Telemetry this process computes must reach the surface operators scrape.

Two gaps, both silent:

* ``tool_latency`` keeps per-tool p50/p95/p99 and ``provider_health`` keeps
  per-provider error rates, and neither was ever exported. An operator scraping
  /metrics could not see the two numbers they would actually alert on, on a
  platform that computes both.
* ``latency_budget.note_elapsed`` called ``record_metric`` with the name
  ``tool_latency_budget_exceeded``, which was never registered --
  ``record_metric`` returns silently for an unknown metric, so every breach was
  recorded into nothing.

These tests assert the values appear in a real scrape rather than that a
function was called, because "we call record_metric" was true the whole time
the metric did not exist.
