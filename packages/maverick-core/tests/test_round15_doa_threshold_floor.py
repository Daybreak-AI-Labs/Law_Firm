"""Audit round 15: a "*" DoA dollar threshold is a FLOOR (strictest-wins).

_threshold_for returned the exact per-action entry whenever present, never
comparing it against a stricter "*" catch-all. So an org-wide
``require_human_above = {"*": 5000}`` (or a ``deny_above`` ceiling) was silently
defeated for any action carrying its own higher threshold -- a money-movement
action could slip its human-approval / deny tier. The catch-all is now a floor:
a per-action key can only tighten it. This holds for a single policy AND for a
composed (union) policy, matching the documented "lowest threshold wins" rule.
