"""The gate that keeps the egress guard's coverage claim true.

``egress_guard`` wraps ``httpx``, ``requests`` and ``urllib``, which covers 93
of the 94 production modules that make direct outbound HTTP. That claim has
exactly one way to quietly stop being true: someone adds a connector using a
client library the guard does not wrap.

That is not hypothetical. It is precisely how the previous design failed -- a
convention that authors had to remember, with nothing failing when they did
not, decaying to 87 ungated modules.
