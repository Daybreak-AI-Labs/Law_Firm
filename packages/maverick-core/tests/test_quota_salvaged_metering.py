"""Quota metering on the Wave-12 *salvaged-patch* completion path (PR #744).

``orchestrator.run_goal`` records each run's spend to the principal's daily
usage ledger via the ``_record_quota_usage`` helper. The metering gap PR #744
flagged was that the salvaged-patch branch -- the success-ish path inside
``if result.error:`` that returns a usable ``result.final_patch`` despite the
agent erroring (e.g. it hit max_steps but had already written a diff via
str_replace_editor) -- returned WITHOUT charging the ledger, so that spend
escaped the quota accounting.

The fix (generalized by #759 into the single ``_record_quota_usage`` helper
called on every terminal path) is exercised here for this specific branch.
The code path was covered but had no test pinning it; without one a future
refactor of the salvaged branch could silently drop the metering again.

Hermetic, mirroring tests/test_quota_enforcement.py (FakeLLM + tmp world db +
LocalBackend + real UsageLedger under the per-test isolated ``~/.maverick``).
The salvaged branch is reached by monkeypatching ``Agent.run`` to return an
``AgentResult`` whose ``error`` is set AND whose ``final_patch`` looks like a
diff -- the exact shape the orchestrator salvages -- exactly as #759's failed
run tests drive the other error paths. No network.
