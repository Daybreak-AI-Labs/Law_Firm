"""Tail-cap defaults: the constants that bound worst-case token injection.

These pins are deliberate: each default was audited (July 2026 token-
efficiency pass) and lowered from a value that let a single tool result,
page fetch, or retry storm dominate the context window or output bill.
Raising one back is a cost decision — do it via the env knob, not here.
