"""Durable, idempotent cron re-arm for the job worker (finding #14).

A recurring CLI schedule (``maverick schedule goal``) carries its cron
expression in ``payload['__cron__']``; the worker enqueues the next occurrence
when it runs the current one. The old re-arm armed exactly once (on
``attempts == 1``) and swallowed any enqueue error, so a single transient
``database is locked`` -- or a crash between claim-commit and re-arm -- silently
and permanently killed the schedule (it ended as a ``done`` row with no
successor and no signal). These tests pin the fix: re-arm is retryable across
attempts, idempotent (never a duplicate successor), and surfaces a persistent
failure as a visible ``failed`` row instead of a dropped schedule.
