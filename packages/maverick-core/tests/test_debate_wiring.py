"""`maverick debate QUESTION` — a CLI entry point for the debate primitive.

run_debate (two LLM debaters argue, a judge picks a winner) existed and was
tested but had no way to invoke it. The command builds a proponent + skeptic
from the configured LLM, runs the debate, and prints the judged verdict.
