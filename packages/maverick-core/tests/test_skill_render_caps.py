"""Skill overlays must be bounded before entering the system prompt.

Regression target: render_for_prompt appended full SKILL.md bodies with no
char cap — the only size limit anywhere was 256 KB at install — so three
recalled skills could inject ~190k tokens into EVERY agent's system prompt,
re-paid by each node of a swarm. The render caps bound the per-body and
combined size; deep workers recall fewer skills than the root.
