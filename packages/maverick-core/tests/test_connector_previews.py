"""Structured consequence previews for governed connector writes.

The property under test throughout: **reversibility is earned, never
asserted.** A plan reports ``reversible=True`` only when it is holding the
thing that inverts the write -- prior field values read back from the record,
or a created record's id it will read out of the create response. Every gap (a
failed restore read, a field the read didn't return, a full-replace PUT, a
DELETE, an unknown connector, restore reads switched off) must fail closed to
``undo=None``, which makes ``run_saga`` refuse before any effect.

Network-free: connector I/O is scripted, so the adapter is exercised without
touching the network, and every read/write it *would* have made is asserted.
