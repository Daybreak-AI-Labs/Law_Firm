"""Concurrency battery for the self-harness store.

The store does a load-modify-save (read the addenda, compose, write). Without
serialization two concurrent passes both read the old store and both write back,
losing one's addendum. This battery runs many batches of CONCURRENT distinct
promotions with a deliberately WIDENED read-modify-write window, so a missing
lock loses updates reliably -- it's a regression guard for the in-process +
cross-process locking, not a flake.

(Scaled by thread/operation count, not 100k rounds: concurrency bugs surface
with parallel writers, not sequential volume.)
