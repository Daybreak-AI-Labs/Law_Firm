"""Stale-job recovery for the persistent JobQueue.

A worker that claims a job and then dies hard (OOM / kill -9 / segfault)
never runs ``complete()`` or ``fail()``, so the row is stranded in
'running' forever -- ``claim()`` only ever picks 'pending' rows. The
``reclaim_stale`` helper (run on worker start) returns such jobs to the
queue, with a poison-pill cap so a job that keeps crashing the process is
eventually failed rather than requeued forever.
