"""`maverick billing invoice` must not mint a misleading $0 invoice for a typo.

UX finding: invoicing a tenant id that does not exist read an absent ledger and
rated to an empty ``TOTAL: $0.00`` invoice at exit 0 -- indistinguishable from a
real "this customer owes nothing" statement, so a typo'd tenant id passed
silently. The guard errors (exit 2) only in the genuinely suspect case -- an
empty invoice for a tenant a provisioned roster has never heard of -- while
leaving every legitimate flow unchanged:

  * a tenant with usage always invoices (so a deleted-but-unpurged tenant whose
    ledger survives can still be billed a final time);
  * a known tenant with no usage in the period is a real $0 invoice, not an error;
  * with no roster provisioned at all (single-tenant / opt-in registry absent)
    nothing errors, because a bare id cannot be validated against a roster.
