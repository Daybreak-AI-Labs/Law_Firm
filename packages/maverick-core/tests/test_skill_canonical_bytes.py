"""_canonical_signed_bytes binds name/triggers/tools_needed/purposes/body.

These run without `cryptography` (pure function), so they pin the actual
security property -- a signed skill's activation triggers, requested tools,
and purpose-scoped recall metadata can't be altered without changing the
signed bytes -- even in environments
where the ed25519 path isn't exercised. The end-to-end sign/verify policy
lives in test_skill_signing.py.

Regression: the canonical form used to be only ``name + "\\n" + body``, so a
signed skill's ``triggers``/``tools_needed``/``purposes`` could be tampered
while the signature still verified.
