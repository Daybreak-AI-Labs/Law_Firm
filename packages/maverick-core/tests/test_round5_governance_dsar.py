"""Audit round 5: governance fail-open on unknown risk floor, DSAR fact
omission, and erasure-verify false-clean on an unresolved channel.

1. ``governance._risk_level`` returned ``None`` for any value outside
   ("low","medium","high"), and a floor only fires when it resolves to a level
   (``policy.deny_min_risk and ...``). So ``deny_min_risk = "critical"`` -- a
   natural, stricter-sounding choice -- silently disabled the deny floor
   entirely (fail-OPEN). Now "critical"/"severe"/"max" map to "high" and any
   other unrecognized value clamps to "high" rather than disabling the gate.

2. ``dsar._export_world`` omitted explicitly user-scoped global facts
   (``user:<channel>:<user_id>:*``) that the erase path *would* delete, breaking
   the erasure verifier's "exported == erasable" invariant and the subject's
   Art.15 right of access. Now exported, attribution-safe.

3. ``erasure_verify.verify_erasure`` returned ``clean=True`` when the channel
   couldn't be resolved: the export fails closed to all-zero counts, which read
   as a clean erasure though nothing was checked. Now ``indeterminate`` and
   ``clean=False``.
