"""Algorithmic-complexity / resource-exhaustion battery for the self-harness loop.

Every other battery checks WHAT mining computes; this one checks HOW IT SCALES.
mine_failures greedily clusters traces by goal-text Jaccard overlap, which is
worst-case O(n*clusters) -- O(n^2) when every trace is a distinct goal. Two
hazards live there:

  1. A naive inner loop re-tokenizes the cluster HEAD on every comparison, so
     the pass becomes tokenize-bound O(n^2) (measured: ~69s on 8k traces). The
     head text never changes, so its token set is cached once -- this battery
     pins that with a DETERMINISTIC tokenization-count assertion (no wall-clock
     flakiness): one tokenization per trace, not one per comparison.

  2. The greedy comparison count is still quadratic, so an unbounded trace list
     could hang a pass. mine_failures caps at _MAX_MINE_TRACES (well above the
     runner's recent-500 feed) and keeps the most recent slice -- a DoS backstop
     for a pathological direct caller.

The memoization must not change results: a brute-force reference clustering is
checked for exact equivalence across randomized inputs.
