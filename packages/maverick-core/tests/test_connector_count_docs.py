"""The connector count in the docs must be derived from the registry, not typed.

Ten documentation locations claimed "214 write-capable" connectors while the
registry held 2,877 -- a 13x internal contradiction that survived because nothing
asserted the number. Two other files (docs/connectors.md, docs/FEATURES.md) had
the right figure the whole time, so the repo simultaneously published both. The
stale number was an *under*-claim, which is why nobody noticed: an inflated
number gets challenged, a deflated one just sits there.

This test is the gate. It fails when the registry grows and the docs don't, which
is the only reliable way to keep prose in step with a list that changes on most
connector PRs.
