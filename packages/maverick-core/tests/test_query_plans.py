"""Query-plan regression guard (ROADMAP 2027 H1, Performance).

The world model ships indexes for its hot access paths (goal_events by goal_id,
turns by conversation_id, episodes by goal_id, approvals by status, ...). A
dropped or shadowed index silently turns those into full table scans that only
bite at scale. This test pins the plan: each hot query must SEARCH **using an
index**, never a full SCAN of the target table.

Robust by construction: an equality filter on an indexed column makes SQLite's
planner pick the index regardless of row count or version, so we assert the
stable "USING INDEX" / "SEARCH" shape rather than a version-fragile exact plan.
