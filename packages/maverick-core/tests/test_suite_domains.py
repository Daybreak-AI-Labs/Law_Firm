"""Built-in business-suite domain packs: load + safety invariants.

These packs are the agents the factory spawns for the business suites (Operations,
Legal, IT-GRC, Sales/GTM, HR, Strategy, and Product&Engineering). Almost every agent
*analyzes and drafts* but never acts on the world, so it must load, carry a persona +
a sealed compartment, and run under a read-only, low/medium-risk capability envelope
(deny wins; the whitelist excludes shell/write). The exception is the
Product&Engineering *builders* -- coding agents that need sandbox-mediated
shell/code_exec -- which instead carry the one hard floor that can never relax: an
agent may build, but never modify its own runtime/safety/controls (``self_edit``
denied). This test is the contract that keeps a new or edited pack from quietly
granting a dangerous tool.
