"""Symlink TOCTOU guard for the filesystem tools.

``_safe_resolve`` resolves + range-checks a path, but the tool then opens it a
moment later — a window in which a symlink swapped into the path can redirect
the open outside the workspace. The fix verifies, THROUGH the opened descriptor
(``/proc/self/fd``), that the inode actually opened is still inside the
workspace. These tests prove (a) legitimate in-workspace symlinks still work and
(b) an escape detected only after the open is refused with no data leak / no
truncation of the outside file.

Linux-only: the fd->realpath check relies on ``/proc/self/fd``. Elsewhere the
guard degrades to the (unchanged) resolve-time check, so there's nothing new to
assert.
