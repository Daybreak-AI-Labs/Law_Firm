"""Facts injected into the orchestrator brief must be scanned/redacted, and
tool output must be secret-redacted before it reaches the model.

Council (Security seat, findings #4-#5 + #14):
  - "Known facts about the user" were concatenated into the orchestrator
    system brief verbatim -- a fact set via REST/MCP (or poisoned by a prior
    injection) became a standing instruction in EVERY future run.
  - Tool output reached the model/blackboard/channel WITHOUT secret_detector
    redaction, so `cat .env` flowed verbatim out a channel.
  - secret_detector missed GitLab PAT / Twilio / bearer / DB connection URIs.

Note: the secret-shaped fixtures below are ASSEMBLED at runtime from
fragments rather than written as literals, so GitHub Push Protection's
secret scanner doesn't (correctly) flag the test file itself.
