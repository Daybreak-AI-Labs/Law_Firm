"""The audit refusal contract, and the gate that keeps it.

Two things are pinned here. First, that both refusals share a base a caller can
catch in one handler -- they were previously unrelated ``RuntimeError``
subclasses, so the single hardened call site in the whole tree was hardened
against the wrong half of the pair. Second, that the gate itself can actually
fail: a gate that cannot fail is the defect class this repo has shipped five
times, so every assertion below has a negative control.
