"""Metamorphic property battery for self-harness mining.

A different methodology again: rather than checking an exact output or a safety
bound, this asserts ALGEBRAIC relations that must hold when the INPUT is
transformed -- permute it, add noise, add other-model / scoped records, raise the
threshold. These catch order-dependence, non-determinism, and leakage that
example-based tests miss. (It caught that the greedy clustering was fully
permutation-variant -- the same failures in a different log order mined different
weaknesses -- now fixed by canonicalizing record order.)

Scales with MAVERICK_SELF_HARNESS_FUZZ_ROUNDS (default 1000).
