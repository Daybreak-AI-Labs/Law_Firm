"""run_goal wiring for per-principal usage quotas (P2 cost governance).

Proves the two integration points added to ``orchestrator.run_goal``:

  1. With quotas enforced and the principal already over its daily cap, the
     run is refused BEFORE the agent loop -- the goal is marked ``blocked`` and
     the LLM is never called (no spend on a principal that's out of budget).
  2. With quotas off (the default), the run proceeds normally and the finished
     run's spend is recorded to the principal's daily ledger.

Hermetic, mirroring tests/test_orchestrator.py (FakeLLM + tmp world db +
LocalBackend) and tests/test_quotas.py (real UsageLedger under the per-test
isolated ``~/.maverick``, env-driven enforcement). No network.
