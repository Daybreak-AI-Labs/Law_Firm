"""One control plane per data root, proven rather than documented.

The single-replica invariant was asserted in eleven places -- the chart, two
raw manifests, six docs, a runbook -- and enforced in exactly one: a
``helm template`` guard. Build-time only, and itself untested and absent from
CI. ``kubectl apply`` on a hand-edited manifest, ``compose up --scale``, or a
second ``maverick dashboard`` on one host all walked past it.

The failure mode is why this matters more than a crash would. Individual
writes are already serialized, so two writers do not tear a record; they
interleave *valid* records into append-only hash chains that assume one
author. The result verifies clean and cannot be reconstructed.

These tests use real processes and real file locks. A mocked lock would prove
the code calls a function, which was never the thing in doubt.
