"""Issue #473 task 4: STOP signals must propagate, not be swallowed.

`BudgetExceeded` (budget cap) and `killswitch.Halted` (the killswitch) are
control-flow signals, not normal failures. Two fan-out sites used to fold them
into ordinary outcomes:

  - `spawn_swarm` gathers children with `return_exceptions=True` and folds each
    result into a tool-result string -> a budget/halt became "ERROR: tool
    raised ...", letting the parent keep spending.
  - best-of-N (`run_goal_best_of_n`) caught every attempt exception, scored the
    candidate zero, and continued to the next attempt -> a cap hit during
    attempt 0 still spawned attempts 1..N.

Both must re-raise these signals (matching agent.py's gather handler).
