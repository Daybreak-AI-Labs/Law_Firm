"""Validate the cross-language MCP surface we promise in the README.

The council recommendation (May 2026) committed us to:
  1. The `maverick mcp` CLI command exists + advertises the
     cross-language surface in its docstring.
  2. The TS / Go / Rust quickstart docs are present, runnable-shaped
     (i.e. have a real fenced code block), and cross-link to the
     council decision in the roadmap.
  3. The roadmap contains the "Language Bindings — Council Decision"
     section with the top-5 language list + the 15% gate.
  4. The main README points consumers at all three quickstarts.

If anyone removes the cross-language surface, this test fails.
