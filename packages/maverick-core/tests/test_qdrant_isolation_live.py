"""Qdrant tenant isolation against a REAL Qdrant server.

Skipped unless MAVERICK_QDRANT_URL points at a running server (the dedicated CI
qdrant job); needs qdrant-client + fastembed. The mock-based unit tests live in
test_qdrant_store.py. This proves the behaviour a mock can't: a real Qdrant
server only accepts uint/UUID point ids, so the store's tenant-namespaced string
ids used to be rejected with a 400 -- now they're deterministic UUIDs with the
logical id in the payload, and add/query/delete are tenant-scoped end to end.
