"""The decode pre-pass runs under the SDK backend too (council finding H2).

Previously the pre-pass was gated on the builtin backend, so any deployment that
actually installed the agent-shield SDK got ZERO encoding-evasion coverage -- an
``rm -rf /`` hidden in base64 reached the tool sink. The variant scan now goes
through the LOCAL builtin floor regardless of backend, so SDK deployments are
covered without multiplying the SDK's remote calls.
