"""Trained cheap-probe seam + offline trainer (C6 increment 3a).

Covers: the additive n-gram feature extension stays backward-compatible; the
hashing is deterministic; the pure-Python trainer separates a clean corpus and
round-trips through the JSON artifact the shield loads; threshold selection
honours the benign false-positive ceiling; and the model only ever RAISES the
heuristic via the MAX ensemble.
