"""CI gate: the shield's hot-path scanners must stay fast on adversarial input.

The shield runs on every agent step and every fetched body. We have shipped
ReDoS hangs of tens of seconds; this gate is what stops the next one.

Two guards, because they catch different failures:

* **Hang guard (subprocess + hard timeout).** A catastrophic backtrack hangs
  *inside* the scan call, so an in-process timer never gets to assert -- only
  killing the process stops it. Crucially, a scan that times out must FAIL the
  build, never be swallowed: a shield call that silently returns "allow" on a
  crafted slow input is a *detection bypass*, not a latency blip.
* **Slow guard (in-process ceiling).** Catches finite-but-slow regressions
  well under the hang timeout.

Mirrors ``packages/maverick-core/tests/test_secrets_scrub_fuzz.py``.
