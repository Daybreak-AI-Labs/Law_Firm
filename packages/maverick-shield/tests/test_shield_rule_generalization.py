"""Generalization + false-positive guard for the round-9 fallback rules.

The end-to-end ASR benchmark exposed detection gaps; round-9 widened/added
rules and lifted held-out TPR 48%->87% with benign FP flat. But those rules
were authored with the benchmark's held-out misses visible, so that number is
partly in-sample. These are FRESH paraphrases (different verbs/structure than
the corpus) that test whether the rules generalize to the *family*, not the
exact sentence -- and fresh benign decoys that name-drop the same vocabulary,
which must NOT block (the FP-anchoring is the safety-critical half).
