"""The base64 de-obfuscation pre-pass must bound how much it decodes+rescans.

Latency finding (round 8): the worst hot-path scan (168ms on 200KB) was a
single huge base64 blob -- _decode_b64_blobs decoded the WHOLE blob and the
scanner then re-ran every rule over the full ~200KB decode. A hidden
prompt-injection INSTRUCTION is short; a 200KB blob is a data payload, not a
concealed prompt. Capping the decoded length keeps the real detection (a short
instruction at the start of the blob is still caught) while cutting the cost.
