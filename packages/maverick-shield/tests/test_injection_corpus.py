"""Adversarial prompt-injection corpus for the shield.

A structured, labelled corpus of injection / jailbreak / obfuscation /
tool-abuse payloads run against the shield's *built-in fallback*
(`maverick_shield.builtin_rules`) -- the always-present detector that
guards the agent when the full ``agent-shield`` SDK isn't installed
(CLAUDE.md rule 1: the kernel runs without the shield, fail-open). The
corpus pins three things so they can't silently regress:

  * attacks the fallback blocks (by category + obfuscation variant),
  * benign text the fallback must NOT block (false-positive floor), and
  * the defense-in-depth seam: softer phrasings the regex fallback misses
    but the `maverick.safety.jailbreak_heuristics` scorer (wired into
    `safety.remote_scan`) catches.

Payloads that NO layer reliably catches yet are listed in ``KNOWN_GAPS``
as ``xfail`` -- tracked, visible, and they flip to a failure (xpass) the
day detection improves, rather than being quietly forgotten.

Obfuscated variants are built at runtime (helpers below) so the source
stays readable and carries no literal encoded blobs.
