"""Maverick's safety chokepoints, backed by Agent Shield with a built-in fallback.

The agent wraps three sinks through this module:
  - on every user input    -> Shield.scan_input
  - on every tool call     -> Shield.scan_tool_call
  - on every final output  -> Shield.scan_output

Backends (chosen automatically in order):
  1. ``agent_shield`` SDK if installed -- note it is not published on PyPI and is
     not vendored here, so in every environment we ship, this backend is
     unavailable and (2) is what actually runs. No detection score is quoted for
     it: the only measured backends are the in-repository layers benchmarked in
     ``benchmarks/security/RESULTS.md``. That generated artifact is authoritative;
     do not copy a score into this module docstring where it can drift.
  2. ``builtin_rules`` (~20 high-impact rules bundled with maverick-shield)
  3. No-op (only if the user explicitly disabled safety via [safety] profile=off)

Fail-open on internal errors -- a broken scanner must not stop the agent --
but never fail-open SILENTLY; the constructor logs which backend is active.
