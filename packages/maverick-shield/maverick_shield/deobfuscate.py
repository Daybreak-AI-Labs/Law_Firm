"""Obfuscation-decode pre-pass for the Shield (C6, increment 1).

The cheap probe and ``builtin_rules`` match attack signatures (``rm -rf /``,
``ignore previous instructions``, ``.ssh/id_rsa`` ...) against the *literal*
text. An attacker bypasses that by encoding the payload: base64, ``\\xHH`` hex,
percent-encoding, or Unicode homoglyphs (Cyrillic ``іgnore`` reads as
"ignore" but is a different codepoint NFKC does **not** fold). The signature
never fires because the malicious words are not present in the surface form.

This module canonicalises the input into a small set of *decoded variants* so
the existing detectors can be run over each. It does NOT classify anything --
it only de-obfuscates; the caller scans every variant through the real
detectors and takes the most-severe verdict. That keeps the design monotonic:
scanning extra variants can only ADD a block, never remove one, so a clean
input stays clean and the existing floor is never weakened.

Everything is bounded (variant count, per-string length, recursion depth) so a
hostile input cannot turn the pre-pass into a decode bomb, and every layer is
fail-safe -- a decode error yields no variant rather than raising.

# Bounds: a hostile input must not be able to amplify into unbounded work.

# silently *stop decoding* on inputs the detectors still scan -- the prior 20k
# bail let `"a"*20001 + base64(payload)` slip an encoded attack past the decode
# step. The first decode layer is bounded by _MAX_LEN (and _HARD_CAP); deeper,
# multiplicative recursion is bounded by _MAX_VARIANTS.
# _MAX_VARIANTS bounds deeper-layer expansion. It is NOT used to cap the count of

# attacker prepend >cap benign base64 tokens to starve the real (trailing)
# payload out of the scanned set. _decode_base64 therefore grants every blob all
