"""Discord bot channel.

Uses the gateway WebSocket so no public webhook is needed. Set up:
  1. Create an application at https://discord.com/developers/applications
  2. Add a Bot user; enable Message Content Intent
  3. Copy the bot token to ${DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN}
  4. Invite the bot to your server with messages.read+send scope

Requires::

    python -m pip install -e './packages/maverick-channels[discord]'
