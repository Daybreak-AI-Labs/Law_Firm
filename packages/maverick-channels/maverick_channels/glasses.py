"""Glasses / wearable channel — Even Realities G2 "bring your own agent" bridge.

Smart glasses do on-device speech-to-text and render short text on a HUD, but
impose a hard request deadline (~30 s on the G2). This adapter implements the
**ack-then-run** pattern that makes a long-horizon agent usable on such a device:

  - a **quick** utterance (a fact, the weather, short chat) is answered
    synchronously within the deadline and shown on the HUD;
  - a **long** task (write code, research, deploy) is **acked immediately**
    ("Got it — working on it; I'll send the result to <channel>"), run in the
    background, and the full result is delivered to a **secondary channel**
    (e.g. Telegram) when done.

The classifier and the deadline split are the whole point and are pure +
unit-tested. The transport is a thin shim over the existing inbound
``POST /webhook/start`` (self-hostable as a small edge service or a Worker), and
long-task results ride the existing outbound delivery — no new server surface.
