"""Threads channel via Meta's Threads API (graph.threads.net).

Why polling, not webhooks: Threads has a webhook product, but subscribing is
partner-gated (business verification + App Review advanced access) — a wall
for self-hosters. The self-host-friendly path is polling the REST edges with
a plain Threads access token, so that is what this adapter does.

Edge choice: ``GET /v1.0/{user_id}/replies`` — the Reply Management edge for
the configured user — polled every ``poll_seconds``. Replies in the user's
own threads are the conversational surface a self-hosted agent actually
answers (someone replied under the bot's post); the alternative mentions
edge needs an extra permission grant and misses replies that don't
@-mention the account, and Threads has no DM API at all. Each reply carries
``username``/``from`` so the *author* — not the transport — is
allowlist-checked (default-deny), and replies authored by the configured
account itself are skipped so the bot can never loop on its own replies.

Dedup: polling re-sees recent replies every cycle, so reply ids are claimed
atomically (``mark_message_processed``) BEFORE processing and released if
the handler fails — the same pattern as whatsapp_cloud. One deliberate
difference: if the claim infrastructure is unavailable the reply is SKIPPED
(fail-closed) and retried next poll, because with no poll cursor "process
anyway" would re-run the same goal every ``poll_seconds``.

Outbound is the documented two-step publish: create a TEXT media container
(``POST /{user_id}/threads``, with ``reply_to_id`` when the target looks
like a media id — all digits, which is what the inbound flow passes), then
publish it (``POST /{user_id}/threads_publish``). Posts cap at 500 chars;
longer replies are chunked into sibling replies on the same target.
