"""whatsapp/sms must import and refuse cleanly when fastapi/twilio are absent.

User-testing finding: ``Form(...)`` as a method DEFAULT ARGUMENT is evaluated
at class-definition (import) time. When fastapi/twilio were missing, ``Form``
was ``None``, so importing the module raised ``TypeError: 'NoneType' object is
not callable`` -- defeating the ``_HAVE_DEPS`` guard in ``__init__`` and giving
the operator a cryptic error instead of the actionable "pip install" message.
