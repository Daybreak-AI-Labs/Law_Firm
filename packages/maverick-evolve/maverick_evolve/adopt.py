"""Adopt an evolution archive's best config into a domain pack.

Closes the loop from offline search to live behavior: ``evolve_continuous``
finds winning configs, but until now they never flowed back into the packs
the agent factory actually spawns from. ``adopt_best`` takes the archive's
best candidate, overlays the chosen keys onto a pack, and writes the result
as an OPERATOR pack (user domains dir overrides built-ins) — never editing
the source pack in place, always leaving a ``.bak`` of any pack it replaces.

Deliberately gated: this is an explicit operator action (CLI ``--adopt``
prints the diff and requires ``--yes``), not an automatic step of any loop —
a config that won offline still deserves a human glance before it changes a
department's live persona.
