"""Bridge the kernel's dream-time rehearsal queue into the eval harness.

``maverick dream`` queues the biggest recurring failure patterns as practice
cases (``~/.maverick/dreams/rehearsals.ndjson``). This bridge turns that
queue into :class:`~maverick_evolve.eval_harness.EvalCase` objects, so
``evolve_with_eval`` / ``evolve_continuous`` optimize agent configs against
the operator's OWN recurring failures instead of (or alongside) a synthetic
benchmark — the data engine eating its own telemetry.

Grading reuses the kernel's ``rehearsal_completed`` signal when the kernel
is importable, with an identical local fallback, so a case passes here
exactly when ``maverick dream --rehearse`` would count it.
