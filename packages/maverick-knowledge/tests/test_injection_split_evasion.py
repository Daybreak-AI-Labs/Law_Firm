"""Regression for the boundary-split injection-evasion gap (audit finding c6).

The per-chunk _INJECTION_RE screen could be bypassed by straddling a tripwire
phrase across a chunk edge (or choosing a small chunk_size) so no single chunk
matched, even though the full document did -- and the poison got ingested.
