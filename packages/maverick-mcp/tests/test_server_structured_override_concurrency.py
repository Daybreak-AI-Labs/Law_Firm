"""Concurrency stress test for the MCP server's per-request structured-override.

HTTP reuses ONE ``MCPServer`` across concurrent clients, so the structured
result a side-effectful tool stashes (``_structured_override``) must stay
isolated per request. Isolation is provided by the ``_STRUCTURED_OVERRIDE_CTX``
ContextVar that ``resource_update_scope`` activates; outside a scope (stdio:
one server : one client) the property falls back to a shared instance attr.

This pins that isolation under real thread concurrency — the structured-override
ContextVar path is the hazard called out in the god-module decomposition
roadmap (``mcp/server.py`` TOOLS). It is a characterization test: it must pass
today (the design is correct) and would fail loudly if a future refactor
reintroduced the shared-attribute leak.
