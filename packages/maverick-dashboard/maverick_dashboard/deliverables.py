"""The persona inbox model: a domain-scoped view of what the fleet delivers.

Where ``/goals`` is one flat list of every run, this groups runs by the
*deliverable* their pack declares (a 13-week cash forecast, a CECL allowance)
and scopes them to the persona role that consumes them -- so an FP&A analyst
sees "my forecasts" and a risk officer sees "assessments awaiting my sign-off"
rather than the same undifferentiated stream.

Pure and presentation-only: the route gathers the pack contracts (specs) and
the recent runs per domain; this shapes them into the view model. A run is
"awaiting sign-off" when its pack declares a gate and the run has finished
(``done``) -- the human review the gate calls for hasn't been recorded yet.
The real approval linkage lands with the governed-handoff step; until then this
is the honest signal we can compute from a run's status.
