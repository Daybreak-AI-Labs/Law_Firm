"""IdP group -> dashboard access mapping (SCIM Groups to roles/departments).

SCIM (``scim.py``) stores the groups an IdP pushes; this module turns that
membership into access, so joining the "Finance Team" in Okta/Entra is what
grants the finance department — no per-user hand assignment:

    [dashboard.group_roles]
    "Finance Team" = "operator"

    [dashboard.group_suites]
    "Finance Team" = ["finance", "tax"]

Group names and role values are matched case-insensitively (an IdP may rename a
group's case, or an operator may capitalize a role). A ``group_suites`` value
may be a single string or a list; unknown suite keys are dropped, so a typo
never silently widens access.

Resolution order (explicit always wins over derived):
  * role:   stored assignment -> group-derived -> ``default_role``
    (wired in ``auth.global_role_for_principal``);
  * suites: explicit grant -> group-derived -> ``[dashboard] default_suites``
    (wired as a kernel grant resolver — see
    :func:`maverick.suite_grants.register_grant_resolver`).

Enforcement reach: the resolver is armed by importing this module, which the
dashboard does at startup (``auth`` imports it). Explicit grants and the
configured default therefore resolve identically in every process, but
group-*derived* grants are only visible where the dashboard resolver is armed.
A pure ``maverick-core`` process (e.g. a worker that never imports the
dashboard) falls back to explicit-grant + default; run department scoping in
**deny-by-default** mode (``[dashboard] default_suites``) if you need a
non-dashboard surface to fail closed for a group-only principal rather than
fall through to unrestricted.

Identity matching is deliberately strict. A dashboard principal is
``user:<sub>`` (the OIDC subject). We match it to a SCIM user only through a
*non-forgeable* binding: the IdP's own ``externalId`` (the usual Okta sub /
Entra immutable object id) or our internal record ``id``. For pairwise-``sub``
IdPs (Entra), where the login sub differs from ``externalId``, we bridge
through the subject directory — but ONLY on those same non-forgeable
identifiers. We never match (directly or via the directory) on
``userName``/``email``: those are contact/display attributes, and the directory
records login ``email``/``upn`` claims WITHOUT an ``email_verified`` check, so
keying a grant on them would let a forged email claim (or a second identity
source) resolve another user's SCIM record and inherit its group-mapped role
and departments. ``subs_for`` stays broad for *revocation* (over-revoking is
safe); *granting* must not. Deactivated (``active=false``) users confer
nothing. Derived access follows the IdP automatically: mappings are read at
resolution time, so removing a user from the group (or the group itself)
revokes on the next request.

Note on trust: with a ``group_roles``/``group_suites`` mapping configured, the
static ``MAVERICK_SCIM_TOKEN`` becomes an authorization-granting credential
(pushing a user into a mapped group confers that group's role/departments).
Treat it with the sensitivity of an admin credential and rotate/scope it
accordingly.
