"""Append-only firing log for event triggers.

Every poll that produced something worth showing -- a fire, a source error, a
template-render skip -- appends one NDJSON row here. The successful *goals* a
trigger spawns are already queryable via ``/automation-runs?kind=event`` (the
goal-origin join); this log adds the part that join can't show: fires that
produced no goal (poll failed, template gone, an event skipped) and a plain
firing count / last-error for each trigger.

Append-only NDJSON (the ``consequence`` store's shape), 0600, best-effort --
never raises, so recording history can't break a poll. Idle polls (nothing new,
no error) are NOT recorded, so the log stays a meaningful fire/error history
rather than a per-tick heartbeat. Owner-stamped for owner-scoped reads.
