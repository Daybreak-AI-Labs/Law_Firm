"""Process-local auth-failure counter, surfaced on ``/metrics``.

Bad-token / failed-auth attempts previously produced only a 401 response and
(sometimes) a log line — no metric, so a credential-stuffing or misconfigured-
client flood was invisible to Prometheus and unalertable. This keeps a small
per-reason tally that the dashboard ``/metrics`` endpoint emits as
``maverick_auth_failures_total{reason="..."}``, so an alert rule can fire on a
spike.

Process-local by design: each worker keeps its own counter and Prometheus
scrapes per instance (same model as the hand-rolled gauges already on
``/metrics``). Standalone module so authentication boundaries and metrics
can increment it without an import cycle.
