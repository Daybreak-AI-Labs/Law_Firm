"""Presentation-only state for the AI assurance operator cockpit.

The gateway module owns evidence authority.  This module never reads or writes
records; it converts its already-projected summary into an operator-friendly
status, prioritized next action, and first-evidence checklist.  Keeping this
logic out of the template makes empty/error states deterministic and testable.
