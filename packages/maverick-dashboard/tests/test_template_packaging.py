"""Guard the wheel/PyInstaller packaging of Jinja templates.

The dashboard ships as a wheel (and a PyInstaller app that bundles that wheel's
data files). Templates are declared in ``[tool.setuptools.package-data]``. A
``.js`` template that a ``.html`` template ``{% include %}``s but that ISN'T
covered by a package-data glob renders fine from a source checkout yet raises
``TemplateNotFound`` at runtime in a built app -- exactly the bug that 500'd the
flow designer (only ``templates/*.html`` was packaged, so the designer's
``flow_designer_core.js`` include was missing from the bundle).

This test fails in CI if any template a page includes wouldn't be packaged.
