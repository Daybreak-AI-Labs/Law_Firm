"""Per-tenant RBAC: a principal can hold a different role in each tenant.

Tenant memberships override the GLOBAL stored role for that tenant only; the
config-pinned bootstrap admin stays globally admin regardless (can't be locked
out of a tenant). No active tenant / no membership => unchanged global behaviour.
